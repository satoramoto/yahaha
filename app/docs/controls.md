## Transport

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Start / Stop** | Starts the band right away, or stops it. Starting from a stop plays the armed Intro first, if you picked one. | START/STOP | `Space` | Pad page 1 (Sections), bottom row, pad 8; Play button |
| **Stop** | Stops the band. Unlike Start / Stop it never starts it. | START/STOP (stop) | — | Stop button |
| **Sync Start** | Arms the band to start on your first left-hand chord. The lamp pulses while it waits. Pressing it while the band plays stops the band and re-arms. | SYNC START | `Y` | Pad page 1 (Sections), top row, pad 4 |
| **Sync Stop** | The band plays only while you hold a chord: let go of every chord key and it stops, play again and it restarts. Not available with the Full Keyboard fingerings. | SYNC STOP | `J` | Pad page 1 (Sections), bottom row, pad 7 |
| **Auto Fill** | When on, switching to another Main plays a fill into it first. | AUTO FILL IN | `U` | Pad page 1 (Sections), top row, pad 8 |
| **Half Bar Fill** | When on, a Main you press on the first beat of a bar plays a fill from the middle of that bar, then the Main at the next bar line, even with Auto Fill off. | Half Bar Fill In | `Shift+N` | — |
| **Fill Up** | Plays a fill, then moves to the next Main to the right (A to B, B to C…). On Main D it plays D's own fill. With the band stopped it picks that Main. | Fill Up | `Shift+S` | — |
| **Fill Down** | Plays a fill, then moves to the next Main to the left (D to C, C to B…). On Main A it plays A's own fill. With the band stopped it picks that Main. | Fill Down | `Shift+A` | — |
| **Fill Self** | Plays the fill of the selected Main (the lit one, or the one waiting to come in), then carries on in it. The same as pressing that Main again. | Fill Self | `Shift+G` | — |
| **Fill Break** | Plays the one-bar Break, then goes back to the Main. The same as Break. | Fill Break | — | — |
| **Stop ACMP** | With Sync Start off and the band stopped, a chord you hold sounds on bass and pad voices. This switches it off, or back on in the mode you picked in Settings (Style at first). | Stop Accompaniment | `H` | Pad page 3 (Chord), bottom row, pad 2 |
| **Fade In/Out** | Stopped, it arms a fade in: the next start comes up from silence. Playing, the band fades out and stops, and stays silent for the hold time before its volume comes back (only the style fades, not what you play). The fade times are in Settings › Style. | Fade In/Out (Assignable) | `Shift+F` | Shift + Stop button |
| **Section Reset** | Starts the section playing again from its top, right now, for stutter effects. With Tap: Section Reset on in Settings › Style (the default, as on the Genos), Tap does the same while the band plays. A pedal can run it too (Style Section Reset). | Style Section Reset (TAP TEMPO) | `\|` | Shift + Play button |
| **Retrigger** | While on, each chord you play restarts the Main and loops its first few beats (the Retrigger length) until you change section or turn it off. Only Mains retrigger. | Style Retrigger (RtgOnOff) | `~` | Pad page 3 (Chord), bottom row, pad 8 |
| **Unison** | While on, each note your right hand plays also sounds on the band: the Bass, Chord, Pad and Phrase parts play with you, in your rhythm, and their own patterns rest. The drums play on, stopped or playing. A pedal given the Unison function turns it on while held. | — | — | — |
| **ACMP** | Auto Accompaniment on or off. Off, the style plays its rhythm only, your chords change nothing, Sync Start starts on any key, and the whole keyboard plays your Right voices (Left below the split when Left is on). One Touch Settings and Chord Looper REC turn it back on. | ACMP | `%` | Shift + encoder page ▼ (right of the knobs) |
| **Retrigger length shorter** | Makes the Retrigger loop one step shorter: 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 of a whole note. | Style Retrigger Rate (RtgRate) | `}` | Shift + > (Scene Launch) button |
| **Retrigger length longer** | Makes the Retrigger loop one step longer, up to a whole note. | Style Retrigger Rate (RtgRate) | `{` | Shift + Function button |
| **Panic** | Sends all notes off on every part, for a stuck note. | — | `\` | — |

| **Section lamps** | Dim: available. Bright: playing, or on. Flashing: queued for the next bar (fills: the next beat). Pulsing: armed and waiting for you, or the Main a fill will land on. Dark: this style doesn't have it. | Section lamp states | — | The pads light the same way, in the same colours |

## Tempo

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tap tempo** | Tap two or more times in time to set the tempo (the last four count); stopped, a whole bar of taps (four in 4/4) starts the style one beat after your last tap, rhythm only until you play a chord. While the band plays, a tap restarts the section instead (Section Reset) and the tempo stays, unless you turn Tap: Section Reset off in Settings › Style. The pad lights on the downbeat while the band plays. | TAP TEMPO | `T` | Pad page 1 (Sections), bottom row, pad 6 |
| **Tempo −** | Slows the tempo by 1 BPM; hold it to keep going, faster the longer you hold. Press − and + together, or double-click the tempo, for the style's own tempo. | TEMPO − | `-` | Function button (right of the pads) |
| **Tempo +** | Speeds the tempo up by 1 BPM; hold it to keep going, faster the longer you hold. Press − and + together, or double-click the tempo, for the style's own tempo. | TEMPO + | `=` | > (Scene Launch) button (right of the pads) |
| **Style tempo** | Back to the tempo the style came with, as pressing TEMPO − and + together does on the Genos. Hold one tempo button and press the other, here or on the Launchkey. | TEMPO − and + together | `+` | Function and > (Scene Launch) pressed together |
| **Tempo** | Sets the tempo directly, 5–500 BPM, as the Tempo knob on the Launchkey does. With focus, the arrow keys move it by 1 BPM. | Tempo | — | Knob 8 on most knob pages |

## Displays

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tempo** | The current tempo in beats per minute. Drag it up or down, or scroll on it, to change it; with focus, ↑ and ↓ step it by 1 BPM. Double-click it for the style's own tempo (Style tempo), which loading a style also sets. | Tempo | — | — |
| **Time signature** | The style's time signature, from the style file. | — | — | — |
| **Bar and beat** | Where the band is: bar, and a light per beat. The section playing now and the one queued next are shown alongside, and for a fill the Main it lands on (⤷). The first press picks the fill; later presses before it ends only change where it lands, and its own Main again repeats it. | — | — | — |
| **Chord** | The chord the style is following. When Keyboard transpose is not zero, the chord as you fingered it is shown small underneath. | Chord (Home display, Style area) | — | — |
| **Status line** | The last message: a loaded style, an error, or a Launchkey note or CC nothing is mapped to, which tells you what a button really sends. | — | — | — |
| **Band sends** | How much of the band (the eight Style parts) goes to the reverb, the chorus and the delay. A dash means the engine hasn't sent it yet. Click to open Effects, where each effect has its band send. | — | — | — |

## Style

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Previous style** | Loads the previous style in the browser's order (folder, then name). While the band plays it keeps playing and follows your next chord in the new style. | — | `←` | < Track button |
| **Next style** | Loads the next style in the browser's order (folder, then name). While the band plays it keeps playing and follows your next chord in the new style. | — | `→` | Track > button |
| **Swing** | Swings the Style live, 0–100 %: 0 plays it as written and 100 moves each straight off-beat to the triplet position, a heavy shuffle. Drums and every accompaniment part follow it, parts already swung are not swung again, and your own keys are never moved. Each new style starts at 0; a registration stores it. | — | — | Knob 6 on the Style knob page |
| **Swing grid** | Which off-beats Swing moves: 1/8 swings the off-beat 8ths (the usual shuffle), 1/16 the off-beat 16ths (a funk or hip-hop swing). | — | — | — |

## Style browser

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| **Recent** | The styles you loaded lately, newest first, however you loaded them. Remembered on this computer. | — | — | — |
| **Load style** | Click or Enter loads this style and closes the browser. While the band plays it keeps playing and follows your next chord in the new style. ▶ marks the loaded style; ‹ and › mark the ones < Track and Track > would load. | — | — | < Track / Track > load the neighbouring rows |
| **Unreadable style** | This file couldn't be read as a style, so it can't be loaded and < Track / Track > skip it. The reason is shown on the row. | — | — | — |
| **Favourite** | Stars or unstars this style, adding it to Favourites. Ctrl+D does the same for the highlighted row. | Favorite | — | — |
| **Preview** | While the band is stopped, plays a few bars of this style over a short default progression without loading it. Shift+Enter previews the highlighted row. | — | — | — |

## Chord detection

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Chord detection: Upper / Lower** | Lower: your left hand plays the chords. Upper: your right hand does (as Fingered*), and your left hand is free for a bass line. | Chord Detection Area | `D` | Pad page 5 (Setup), top row, pad 8 |
| **Manual Bass** | In Upper, mutes the style's Bass and gives its voice to Left, so your left hand plays the bass. Left stays on while it's on. Dark in Lower, where it isn't available. | Manual Bass | `Shift+D` | Pad page 3 (Chord), bottom row, pad 1 |
| **Left Hold** | Left keeps sounding after you let go of its keys, until you play the next note on Left, stop the style, or turn Left Hold off. A string or organ Left holds your chord across the band. | LEFT HOLD | `_` | Panel fader page: button under fader 7 (orange while on) |

## Split point

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Transpose

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |

## One Touch Settings

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OTS 1** | A sound setup for your own hands that the style's author picked to suit it: the voice, on/off, volume and octave of Right 1–3 and Left. Pressing it applies it at once, swapping your keyboard sounds (or loading the rack of yours chosen for it), and the band doesn't change. Dark if the style has none. | ONE TOUCH SETTING 1 | `Shift+1` | Pad page 2 (Racks), bottom row, pad 1 |
| **OTS 2** | The style's second suggested setup for your hands: the voice, on/off, volume and octave of Right 1–3 and Left. Pressing it applies it at once, swapping your keyboard sounds, and the band doesn't change. If you chose one of your racks for it (OTS rack), that rack loads instead. | ONE TOUCH SETTING 2 | `Shift+2` | Pad page 2 (Racks), bottom row, pad 2 |
| **OTS 3** | The style's third suggested setup for your hands: the voice, on/off, volume and octave of Right 1–3 and Left. Pressing it applies it at once, swapping your keyboard sounds, and the band doesn't change. If you chose one of your racks for it (OTS rack), that rack loads instead. | ONE TOUCH SETTING 3 | `Shift+3` | Pad page 2 (Racks), bottom row, pad 3 |
| **OTS 4** | The style's fourth suggested setup for your hands: the voice, on/off, volume and octave of Right 1–3 and Left. Pressing it applies it at once, swapping your keyboard sounds, and the band doesn't change. If you chose one of your racks for it (OTS rack), that rack loads instead. | ONE TOUCH SETTING 4 | `Shift+4` | Pad page 2 (Racks), bottom row, pad 4 |
| **OTS rack** | What this OTS button loads while this style is loaded: the style's own setup, or one of your racks instead. The choice is kept for this style in your data folder (the style file isn't touched), and the Racks pad page, the pedals and OTS Link follow it. Style's own puts it back. | — | — | — |
| **OTS Link** | When on, your hands' sounds follow the band: pressing Main A, B, C or D also recalls OTS 1, 2, 3 or 4. Changing style recalls the setting for the Main that's playing. | OTS LINK | `F10` | Pad page 5 (Setup), bottom row, pad 1; Shift + Pad Bank ▼ |
| **OTS Link timing** | When OTS Link swaps the setting while the band plays: when the band reaches the Main you pressed (At Main Section Change, the default), or as soon as you press it (Immediate). Change it in Settings, Style. | OTS Link Timing | — | — |

## Quick Racks

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |

| **Right 2 on/off** | Turns Right 2 on or off. Turn on Right 1 and Right 2 together to layer, for example piano and strings. On screen, press and hold its part lamp to swap its sound: the knobs are Right 2's (knob 1 its sound, 2–8 its mix) until you click the lamp again. | PART ON/OFF RIGHT 2 | `6` | Panel fader page: button under fader 2 |
| **Right 3 on/off** | Turns Right 3 on or off, a third layer for the right hand. On screen, press and hold its part lamp to swap its sound: the knobs are Right 3's (knob 1 its sound, 2–8 its mix) until you click the lamp again. | PART ON/OFF RIGHT 3 | `7` | Panel fader page: button under fader 3 |

| **Octave +** | Shifts this part up an octave (up to +2). OTS recalls set it too. | Voice Setting → Tune → Octave | — | — |
| **Plugin** | Plays this part on an instrument plugin instead of its SoundFont voice. It loads in the background (the part keeps its SoundFont voice until then), and the fader stays the part's volume (CC 7). "⚠ in process" means macOS would not run the plugin in its own process, so it runs inside yahaha: if it crashes, yahaha goes with it. | — | — | — |
| **Edit plugin** | Opens the plugin's own window to change its sound. yahaha keeps the plugin's settings with the part. | — | — | — |
| **Rescan plugins** | Looks for newly installed or removed instrument plugins. A ⚠ in the Sound Browser marks a plugin that failed to load last time. | — | — | — |
| **Reload plugin** | Loads the selected part's plugin again, with its saved sound, after it stopped working or failed to load. | — | `S` | — |
| **Run in process** | Runs this plugin inside yahaha instead of in its own process: a little less CPU for the lightest plugins, but if the plugin crashes, yahaha goes with it. It is remembered for the plugin and applies from its next load: a part already playing it keeps running where it is, and the button shows ↻ until the plugin loads again (pick it again, or the next start). | — | — | — |
| **Layer** | The Right parts that are on all sound together on every key above the split: that's a layer. Turn on Right 1 and Right 2 to stack, for example, piano and strings. | PART ON/OFF (Right 1–3 layered) | `5` `6` `7` | Panel fader page: buttons under faders 1–3 |
| **Left hand** | Left plays the keys at and below the split point, with its own voice. Under Manual Bass it plays the style's Bass voice there instead, and the band's own bass goes quiet. | Split Point (Left) | — | — |
| **As written for** | The voice the style's author wrote this band part for, and its MIDI channel on the yahaha port. Load a matching instrument on that channel in Ableton to hear the style as intended; ≈ marks the nearest General MIDI voice to a Yamaha one. | Style parts (Mixer › Style) | — | — |
| **Plugin instances** | How many instrument plugins are loaded right now: one for every keyboard or Style part that plays a plugin (each part gets its own), plus one still playing out while its part's next plugin loads. | — | — | — |
| **Library patch** | The part plays a patch from your sound library. Pick a GM voice instead to go back to it. | Voice Selection | — | — |
| **Swap sound** | Hold a part's Panel fader button and turn knob 1 to step that part's sound by number, live, keeping its mix; knobs 2–8 are its mix. Let go to keep the sound (dialling back is the cancel); a hold that turns no knob is a tap, which turns the part on or off. On screen, press and hold a keyboard part's lamp under its fader: swap stays on when you let go, so you can turn the knobs here, and a click on that lamp ends it. | — | — | Panel fader page: hold the button under fader 1–4 and turn knob 1 |

## Rack panel

| **Replace…** | The plugin this part plays isn't installed, so the part is silent. Opens Library › Sounds with this part as the target: the sound you pick replaces it and the part keeps its level, pan, sends and octave.

## Keyboard Harmony / Arpeggio

|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Arpeggio Hold pedal** | The Arpeggio Hold pedal switch, from the app. On: the arpeggio plays on after you let go, as with the pedal held down. | Arpeggio Hold (foot pedal) | — | — |
| **Harmony/Arpeggio** | Turns the selected Keyboard Harmony type or arpeggio on or off for the keys right of the split. Turning it off stops the arpeggio at once; keys you hold keep their harmony notes until you let go. | HARMONY/ARPEGGIO | `Shift+J` | Panel fader page: button under fader 5 |
| **Harmony types** | Shows the Keyboard Harmony types and selects the one last used: duets, trios, block and 4-way voicings, 1+5, Octave, Strum, Multi Assign, Echo, Tremolo and Trill. | Keyboard Harmony | — | — |
| **Arpeggio patterns** | Shows the arpeggio patterns and selects the one last used. They are yahaha's own patterns, not Yamaha's. | Arpeggio | — | — |
| **Harmony type** | Selects this Keyboard Harmony type. The harmony follows the chord you play for the style, and only the top note of your right hand is harmonised. | Keyboard Harmony type | — | — |

| **Next type** | Steps on through the Harmony types and then the arpeggios, as one list. | — | `Shift+L` | — |

| **Assign** | Which Right parts sound the effect. Auto: the added notes and repeats on the first Right part that is on, the arpeggio on every Right part that is on; Multi (Harmony types and Echo only): the melody on the first, the added notes spread over the others; Right 1–3: that part. | Assign | — | — |
| **Chord Note Only** | Harmonises only melody notes that belong to the chord you are playing. Passing notes play plainly. | Chord Note Only | — | — |
| **Touch Limit** | The effect sounds only for keys played at least this hard, so you can accent single notes with a harmony. | Minimum Velocity | — | — |
| **Arpeggio Quantize** | Starts the pattern on the nearest eighth or sixteenth of the style's grid, so a chord played a little early or late still lands in time. | Arpeggio Quantize | — | — |
| **Arpeggio Hold** | The pattern keeps playing after you let go of the keys, until you turn Hold or Harmony/Arpeggio off. The next chord you play replaces it. A pedal set to Arpeggio Hold holds it too while the pedal is on, without changing this setting. | Arpeggio Hold | `*` | — |
| **Arpeggio velocity** | Where the arpeggio's loudness comes from: the pattern's own accents, how hard you played each key, or one fixed velocity. | — | — | — |
| **Fixed velocity** | The velocity every arpeggio note plays at when the velocity is Fixed. | — | — | — |
| **Keep Key On** | The pattern's clock keeps running while no key is held, so the next chord picks up in the middle of the phrase instead of starting it again. | — | — | — |
| **Close Harmony/Arpeggio** | Closes the Harmony/Arpeggio panel. The effect stays as it is. | — | `Esc` | — |
| **Category** | Shows this category's Harmony types or arpeggio patterns. The type you have stays until you pick another, so looking around never stops an Echo or an arpeggio. | Keyboard Harmony / Arpeggio type | — | — |

## Mixer

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fader page: Panel / Style** | Switches what the Launchkey faders control: Panel is your four keyboard parts, Style is the band's eight parts. On the Launchkey, a tap of the button under the master fader switches; hold it and the pads show the fader page and layer to choose from; with Shift it steps to the next fader layer instead. The button lights in the layer's colour on Panel, green on Style. | Mixer tabs (Panel / Style) | `F9` | Tap the button under the master fader (hold: choose the fader page and layer on the pads) |
| **Fader layer: VOL / PAN / REV / CHO / DLY** | Switches what the faders move across the parts, as in a DAW's sends view: each part's volume, or its pan, reverb, chorus or delay send.

| **Chorus** | How much of this part goes to the shared chorus: its channel's CC 93 (0 at start: dry). Drag up or down; double-click for 0. It stays where you set it while you play; only recalling a One Touch Setting or a rack that stores sends (or a sound library patch that sets one) changes it. | Mixer › Panel › Effect › Chorus | — | — |
| **Delay** | How much of this part goes to the tempo delay (the Variation effect): its channel's CC 94 (0 at start: no echo). Drag up or down; double-click for 0. The Delay type in Effects above sets the note length. | Mixer › Panel › Effect › Variation | — | — |
| **EQ Low** | Boosts or cuts this part's lows, below the Low frequency, by −12 to +12 dB: a shelf yahaha plays on the part's audio, SoundFont voice or plugin, and at 0 dB out of the signal (tone, not level: the fader stays the part's only level). Drag up or down; double-click for 0 dB. A One Touch Setting with an EQ sets it, and a rack saves it. | Mixer › Panel › EQ › Low | — | — |
| **EQ Low frequency** | Where this part's low shelf starts: 32 Hz to 2 kHz, in the XG EQ frequency steps (80 Hz at start). It changes nothing while EQ Low is at 0 dB. Drag up or down; double-click for 80 Hz. | Voice Edit › EQ › Low Frequency | — | — |
| **EQ High** | Boosts or cuts this part's highs, above the High frequency, by −12 to +12 dB: a shelf yahaha plays on the part's audio, SoundFont voice or plugin, and at 0 dB out of the signal (tone, not level: the fader stays the part's only level). Drag up or down; double-click for 0 dB. A One Touch Setting with an EQ sets it, and a rack saves it. | Mixer › Panel › EQ › High | — | — |
| **EQ High frequency** | Where this part's high shelf starts: 500 Hz to 16 kHz, in the XG EQ frequency steps (10 kHz at start). It changes nothing while EQ High is at 0 dB. Drag up or down; double-click for 10 kHz. | Voice Edit › EQ › High Frequency | — | — |
| **Insert effect** | The effect in this part's insert slot: Distortion (an amp simulator), Compressor, Auto Wah, Tremolo (at the style tempo) or Rotary (a rotary speaker; the Rotary fast switch sets its speed). It plays on the part's own sound, SoundFont voice or plugin, before its fader and sends; picking one doesn't turn the slot on. A One Touch Setting with an insertion effect sets it, and a rack saves it. | Mixer › Effect › Insertion Effect › Type | — | — |
| **Insert on** | This part's insert slot on or off. Off, the part sounds exactly as with no insert at all. The style's Inserts switch doesn't touch it. | Mixer › Effect › Insertion Effect › On/Off | — | — |
| **Insert amount** | How hard this part's insert works, 0–127: the distortion's drive, the compressor's squeeze, the wah's sensitivity, or the tremolo's and rotary's depth. The effect sees the part at full volume, so the fader doesn't change how hard it drives. Drag up or down; double-click for 64. | Mixer › Effect › Insertion Effect › Depth | — | — |
| **EQ Low** | Boosts or cuts this strip's lows with a shelf, −12 to +12 dB. 0 dB takes the band out of the signal. | Mixer › EQ › Low Gain | — | — |
| **EQ Low frequency** | Where this strip's low shelf starts: 32 Hz to 2 kHz (80 Hz at start). | Mixer › EQ › Low Frequency | — | — |
| **EQ High** | Boosts or cuts this strip's highs with a shelf, −12 to +12 dB. 0 dB takes the band out of the signal. | Mixer › EQ › High Gain | — | — |
| **EQ High frequency** | Where this strip's high shelf starts: 500 Hz to 16 kHz (10 kHz at start). | Mixer › EQ › High Frequency | — | — |
| **Strip compressor** | This strip's own compressor on or off, after its EQ and before its inserts. Off, the part plays as with none. | — | — | — |
| **Compressor type** | The strip compressor's character: Natural, Rich, Punchy, Electronic or Loud. Choosing one sets all its parameters. | — | — | — |
| **Threshold** | The level above which the strip compressor works, −48 to 0 dB. | — | — | — |
| **Ratio** | How hard the strip compressor squeezes what goes over the threshold, 1:1 to 20:1. | — | — | — |
| **Attack** | How fast the strip compressor clamps down, 1 to 100 ms. | — | — | — |
| **Release** | How fast the strip compressor lets go, 10 to 1000 ms. | — | — | — |
| **Make-up** | Gain after the strip compressor, 0 to 24 dB, to make up what it takes away. | — | — | — |
| **Insert type** | The effect in this insert slot: None, Distortion, Compressor, Auto Wah, Tremolo, Rotary or Phaser. A new type starts at its own settings; on/off stays as it was. | Mixer › Effect › Insertion Effect › Type | — | — |
| **Insert on** | This insert slot on or off. Off, the strip sounds as with no insert in the slot. | Mixer › Effect › Insertion Effect › On/Off | — | — |
| **Insert setting 1** | The insert's first setting (its drive, squeeze, sensitivity or depth: what the old single amount was). Drag up or down; double-click for the type's default. | Mixer › Effect › Insertion Effect › Parameter | — | — |
| **Insert setting 2** | The insert's second setting, named on the knob (tone, attack, resonance, note, drive or rate). Drag up or down; double-click for the type's default. | Mixer › Effect › Insertion Effect › Parameter | — | — |
| **Insert setting 3** | The insert's third setting, named on the knob. Drag up or down; double-click for the type's default. | Mixer › Effect › Insertion Effect › Parameter | — | — |
| **Insert setting 4** | The insert's fourth setting, where its type has one (the compressor's output). Drag up or down; double-click for the type's default. | Mixer › Effect › Insertion Effect › Parameter | — | — |
| **Send level** | How much of this strip goes to this send effect, 0–127. Sends 1–3 are the part's reverb, chorus and delay sends. | Mixer › Effect › Send level | — | — |
| **Level** | This part's level (its CC 7), 0–127. Drag up or down. | Mixer › Volume | — | Panel faders 1–4 (keyboard parts); Style page faders 1–8 (Style parts) |
| **Pan** | Where this part sits left to right (CC 10), 64 = centre. Drag up or down; double-click for centre. | Mixer › Pan | — | — |
| **Previous part** | Shows the part before this one in the Channel view (after Right 1 comes Phrase 2). | — | — | — |
| **Next part** | Shows the part after this one in the Channel view (after Phrase 2 comes Right 1). | — | — | — |
| **Close the channel** | Closes the Channel view and puts back what the display showed before. Esc, or clicking the selected strip again, does the same. | — | `Esc` (terminal: ) | — |
| **Style volume** | The whole band against your hands, in one fader: 100 plays the Style parts at their own levels, lower scales every Style part's CC 7 down together (above 100 raises them, up to 127), the way a Fade In/Out does. The part faders stay where they are. | Balance › Style (Mixer › Panel › Style) | — | Panel fader page: fader 5 |
| **Multi Pad volume** | All four Multi Pads against the band, in one fader: 100 plays each pad at its own level, lower scales the pads' CC 7 down together (above 100 raises them, up to 127). | Balance › M.Pad (Mixer › Panel › Multi Pad) | — | Panel fader page: fader 6 |
| **Style part volume** | This band part's volume. The fader is its channel's CC 7 itself (channels 9–16), with no hidden gain behind it, except that a Fade In/Out scales the CC 7 it sends while the fade runs (the fader stays put). Loading a style sets the faders to the style's own levels, and a pattern that changes its volume moves the fader too, until you move it yourself. | Mixer › Style › Volume | — | Style fader page: faders 1–8 (Rhythm 1 … Phrase 2) |
| **Style part reverb** | How much of this band part goes to the shared reverb. It shows the style's own CC 91 until you turn it; then your value replaces the style's on this part, through section and style changes, on the MIDI port and in the synth, and the Band reverb scale no longer applies to it. Double-click hands the part's sends back to the style. | Mixer › Style › Effect › Reverb | — | — |
| **Style part chorus** | How much of this band part goes to the shared chorus. It shows the style's own CC 93 until you turn it; then your value replaces the style's on this part, through section and style changes, and the Band chorus scale no longer applies to it. Double-click hands the part's sends back to the style. | Mixer › Style › Effect › Chorus | — | — |
| **Style part delay** | How much of this band part goes to the tempo delay (the Variation effect). It shows the style's own CC 94 until you turn it; then your value replaces the style's on this part, through section and style changes, and the Band delay scale no longer applies to it. Double-click hands the part's sends back to the style. | Mixer › Style › Effect › Variation | — | — |
| **Sends: reset to style** | Hands every band part's reverb, chorus and delay back to the style: each part's knobs go back to the style's own CC 91/93/94, and the Band scales in Effects apply again. Double-click one knob to reset only that part. | Mixer › Style › Effect (Reset) | — | — |
| **Style part on/off** | Mutes or unmutes this band part. The Launchkey button is lit while the part plays. | Channel On/Off | `Z` `X` `C` `V` `B` `N` `M` `,` | Style fader page: buttons under faders 1–8 |
| **Plugin part** | This part plays an instrument plugin, shown with its share of one CPU core, updated every second. Its fader is still the part's CC 7, applied to the plugin's output. | — | — | — |
| **Plugin running slow** | "N slow" counts the plugin's renders in the last 10 seconds that took more than half the audio buffer, the first sign of crackles. Raise Settings › Audio › Buffer size to give it more time, or use a lighter plugin or preset. | — | — | — |
| **Plugin in process ⚠** | This part's plugin was meant to run in its own process, where a crash only silences the part. macOS refused to host it there, so it runs inside yahaha instead: if it crashes, yahaha goes with it. Save your setup, or pick another plugin for live use. | — | — | — |
| **Master volume** | The built-in synth's output level (100 = unity), the only gain after the channel faders. A safety soft clipper above −1 dBFS keeps loud passages from hard clipping; below that the output is untouched. It does not change the MIDI output. | MASTER VOLUME | — | Master fader (both fader pages) |
| **Solo** | Plays only this part, even if it is switched off; press again to end the solo. The Style tab solos a band part, the Panel tab a keyboard part, and the On switches stay as they were. | Mixer › touch and hold a channel (Solo) | — | — |
| **Style Track Mute** | A knob for the band: fully left leaves one part on, and turning it up brings the others in one by one until all eight play. It switches the Style parts on and off, so the On buttons follow it. | Live Control › Style Track Mute A/B (StyMuteA, StyMuteB) | — | Knobs 4 and 5 on the Style knob page |
| **Track Mute order** | A starts from Rhythm 2, then Rhythm 1, Bass, Chord 1, Chord 2, Pad, Phrase 1 and Phrase 2. B starts from Chord 1, then Chord 2, Pad, Bass, Phrase 1, Phrase 2 and the rhythm parts last. | Style Track Mute A / B | — | — |
| **MIDI out channel** | The channel this part plays on at yahaha's MIDI output: Right 1 = 1, Left = 2, Right 2 = 3, Right 3 = 4, the band 9–16. Map a DAW track (Ableton: MIDI From yahaha, this channel) to record or re-voice it. | Part / Style channel | — | — |
| **Cutoff** | Opens or closes this part's filter, relative to the voice: above 64 brighter, below 64 darker. 64 is the voice's own. | Voice Edit › Filter › Cutoff | — | — |
| **Resonance** | Boosts the filter around its cutoff, relative to the voice: above 64 a sharper, more peaky tone. 64 is the voice's own. | Voice Edit › Filter › Resonance | — | — |
| **Attack** | How quickly each note reaches full level, relative to the voice: above 64 slower, below 64 faster. 64 is the voice's own. | Voice Edit › EG › Attack | — | — |
| **Decay** | How quickly a held note falls from its peak, relative to the voice: above 64 slower, below 64 faster. 64 is the voice's own. | Voice Edit › EG › Decay | — | — |
| **Release** | How long a note rings on after you let go, relative to the voice: above 64 longer, below 64 shorter. 64 is the voice's own. | Voice Edit › EG › Release | — | — |
| **Vibrato rate** | How fast the vibrato wobbles, relative to the voice: above 64 faster, below 64 slower. 64 is the voice's own. | Voice Edit › Vibrato › Speed | — | — |
| **Vibrato depth** | How far the vibrato bends the pitch, relative to the voice: above 64 deeper, below 64 shallower. 64 is the voice's own. | Voice Edit › Vibrato › Depth | — | — |
| **Vibrato delay** | How long a note plays before the vibrato starts, relative to the voice: above 64 later, below 64 sooner. 64 is the voice's own. | Voice Edit › Vibrato › Delay | — | — |
| **Mono** | Lit, this part plays one note at a time: a new note cuts off the one before, as on a solo instrument. Off, it plays chords (poly). | Voice Edit › Mono/Poly | — | — |
| **Portamento** | Lit, this part glides in pitch from one note to the next instead of jumping. Portamento time sets how long the glide takes. | Voice Edit › Portamento | — | — |
| **Portamento time** | How long the glide between notes takes while Portamento is on, 0–127: higher is slower. | Voice Edit › Portamento Time | — | — |
| **Part name** | Opens Channel for this part: on the Stage, it selects the part and shows the Channel tab (coming soon). A keyboard part (Right 1–3, Left) also becomes the part you edit, as the Launchkey's part buttons do. | Mixer › channel | — | — |
| **Voice** | The sound this part plays. On a keyboard part, click to choose another in Library › Sounds, loading into this part. A Style part plays the voice the style names; the name is cut short on a narrow strip, so hover it for the whole name. | Mixer › Voice | — | — |
| **Track CPU** | How much of each audio buffer this track takes to render over the last second (its SoundFont voices, filter and insert effect, or its plugin), where 100% is the whole buffer. "pk" is its slowest single buffer, red past half the buffer, where dropouts start. A larger audio buffer (Settings) gives a heavy plugin more room. | — | — | — |
| **Group CPU** | How much of each audio buffer this group's tracks take together to render over the last second, where 100% is the whole buffer; red past half the buffer. "≤ pk" adds up each track's slowest single buffer. Those need not happen in the same buffer, so it is only an upper bound and never turns the readout red; each strip's own CPU shows its track's real peak. | — | — | — |
| **CPU, all tracks** | Every track's render time together, as a share of the audio buffer, over the last second, and the slowest single buffer (pk). The effects bus and the output are not in it. Near 100% at the peak, the audio drops out: raise the audio buffer in Settings, or find the expensive track on its strip. | — | — | — |
| **A fader is the channel's CC 7** | Each fader shows and sends exactly its channel's CC 7 (0–127), with no hidden gain anywhere, so the MIDI output and the synth hear the same level. Loading a style sets the Style faders to the style's own levels. While a Fade In/Out runs, the Style parts' CC 7 goes out scaled by the fade, and the faders stay where they are. | Mixer › Volume | — | The faders, on both fader pages |
| **Waiting for the fader** | This level moved without the Launchkey fader (a style load, an OTS recall, a pattern, a page switch). The hardware fader does nothing until you move it to within 2 of the level, or across it. | — | — | Soft takeover on every fader |

## Effects

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Reverb type** | The shared reverb every part sends to (CC 91): Hall (large, long), Room (small, short), Stage (in between, brighter) or Plate (dense and bright). | Mixer › Effect › Reverb type | — | — |
| **Reverb return** | How loud the reverb comes back into the mix: 64 is 0 dB, 127 is +6 dB, 0 is off. | Mixer › Effect › Reverb Return Level | — | Pan knob page, knob 5 |
| **Chorus type** | The shared chorus every part sends to (CC 93): Chorus (warm, wide), Celeste (a gentle detune) or Flanger (the sweeping comb). | Mixer › Effect › Chorus type | — | — |
| **Chorus return** | How loud the chorus comes back into the mix: 64 is 0 dB, 127 is +6 dB, 0 is off. | Mixer › Effect › Chorus Return Level | — | Pan knob page, knob 6 |
| **Delay type** | The tempo delay every part sends to (CC 94), in step with the style tempo: an echo every 1/8, dotted 1/8 or 1/4 note, or Ping-Pong (1/8, alternating left and right). | Mixer › Effect › Variation type (Tempo Delay) | — | — |
| **Delay return** | How loud the echoes come back into the mix: 64 is 0 dB, 127 is +6 dB, 0 is off. | Mixer › Effect › Variation Return Level | — | Pan knob page, knob 7 |
| **Reverb time** | How long the reverb rings on: the time it takes to die away by 60 dB, 0.3 to 10 seconds. Each type starts at its own (Hall 2.4 s); the tick marks it. Changes glide, so turning it while the tail rings never clicks. | Mixer › Effect › Edit › Reverb Time | — | FX knob page, knob 1 |
| **Pre-delay** | A gap before the reverb starts, 0 to 200 ms: a longer one keeps the notes clear of their reverb, as in a bigger room. Each type starts at its own (Hall 22 ms); the tick marks it. | Mixer › Effect › Edit › Initial Delay | — | FX knob page, knob 2 |
| **Reverb tone** | How bright the reverb tail is: the high cut inside the reverb, 1 to 20 kHz. Lower damps the highs sooner for a darker, warmer room; each type starts at its own (Hall 4.5 kHz). | Mixer › Effect › Edit › High Damp | — | FX knob page, knob 3 |
| **Delay tempo sync** | On, the echoes follow the style tempo at the Note value; off, they repeat at the free Time in milliseconds, whatever the tempo. | Mixer › Effect › Edit › Tempo Delay / Delay | — | — |
| **Delay note** | The echo time as a note value at the style tempo: 1/16, 1/8 triplet, 1/8, 1/4 triplet, dotted 1/8, 1/4, dotted 1/4 or 1/2. Used with tempo sync on; a tempo change glides the echoes to the new length. | Mixer › Effect › Edit › Delay Time (note) | — | FX knob page, knob 4 (tempo sync on) |
| **Delay time** | The echo time in milliseconds, 10 to 2000, used with tempo sync off. Changes glide, so the echoes bend to the new time rather than click. | Mixer › Effect › Edit › Delay Time | — | FX knob page, knob 4 (tempo sync off) |
| **Delay feedback** | How much of each echo comes back as the next one, 0 to 90%: 0 is a single echo, higher keeps them going longer (38% at start). | Mixer › Effect › Edit › Feedback Level | — | FX knob page, knob 5 |
| **Delay tone** | The high cut on the echoes, 1 to 20 kHz: each repeat passes through it again, so lower makes later echoes darker, like a tape echo (5 kHz at start). | Mixer › Effect › Edit › High Damp | — | — |
| **Ping-pong** | On, the echoes bounce between left and right instead of each side repeating itself. Switching crossfades, so it never clicks. | Mixer › Effect › Edit › Tempo Cross | — | — |
| **Chorus rate** | How fast the chorus sweeps, 0.05 to 5 Hz: slow is a gentle shimmer, fast a vibrato-like warble. Each type starts at its own (Chorus 0.55 Hz); a change keeps the sweep where it is, so it never clicks. | Mixer › Effect › Edit › LFO Frequency | — | FX knob page, knob 6 |
| **Chorus depth** | How far the chorus sweeps, 0 to 5 ms: more is a wider detune, 0 is no movement at all. Each type starts at its own (Chorus 2.2 ms); changes glide. | Mixer › Effect › Edit › LFO Depth | — | FX knob page, knob 7 |
| **From style** | Lit, this effect takes the style's own type at every style change (the style's choice shows on the display, the nearest type yahaha has), with the style's delay time and feedback, its reverb time, pre-delay and tone, and its return level (0 dB where it sets none). Choosing a type or turning one of its knobs yourself (here or on a Launchkey effect knob page) switches to Mine so your choice stays; press it to go back to the style's. | Mixer › Effect (Style effect types) | — | — |
| **Mine** | Lit, this effect keeps your own type and settings through style changes. Choosing a type or turning one of its knobs switches here by itself; From style goes back to the style's. | Mixer › Effect (Panel effect types) | — | — |
| **Style inserts** | The style's own insertion effects: an effect the style puts on one of its parts, such as an amp simulator on the guitar or a compressor on the bass (listed below: the part, the style's effect, and what plays it here, or dry where yahaha has nothing near it). Lit, they play on the part's sound, in the built-in synth or a plugin playing the part, before its sends; off, every Style part plays dry. The keyboard parts' own insert slots (on their mixer strips) are not affected. | Mixer › Effect › Insertion (Style parts) | — | — |
| **Part insert** | This Style part's own insertion effect on or off, leaving the other parts' as they are. Lasts until the next style, which brings its own inserts; the Inserts switch still turns them all off together. | Mixer › Effect › Insertion (part on/off) | — | — |
| **Insert amount** | How hard this Style part's insertion effect works: the amp simulator's drive, the compressor's squeeze, the wah's sensitivity, or the tremolo's and rotary's depth. Starts at the style's own value and lasts until the next style. | Mixer › Effect › Insertion › Parameter | — | — |
| **Rotary fast** | The rotary speaker switch: lit, every rotary insert spins at its fast speed; off, its slow one. The horn and drum speed up and slow down gradually, as a real rotary speaker does. | Rotary Speaker speed (Slow/Fast) | — | — |
| **Add send** | Adds a send effect (up to six), returning at 0 dB. Every strip starts with no level to it. The rack saves it. | — | — | — |
| **Remove send** | Removes this added send effect; the ones after it move down with every strip's level to them. Sends 1–3 stay. | — | — | — |
| **Send type** | What this send effect plays. Sends 1–3 take their own family (reverbs, choruses, delays); an added send can play any type. A new type starts at its own parameters. | Mixer › Effect › Type | — | — |

| **Rack keeps this type** | Lit, the live rack keeps this send's type and brings it back when loaded, over the style's. Off, the style sets it. | — | — | — |
| **Use style's** | Drops the live rack's type for this send, so the style sets it again. | — | — | — |
| **New send type** | What the next added send effect plays. Add send adds it. | Mixer › Effect › Type | — | — |
| **Master Compressor** | A compressor on the whole mix, after the effects and before the output: it evens out the dynamics, bringing loud passages down. Lit, it plays (not on the metronome); off, the mix is untouched. It stays as set until you change it, even after a restart. | Mixer › Master › Compressor | — | — |
| **Master Compressor type** | The compressor's character: Natural (moderate), Rich (gentle, for acoustic music), Punchy (heavy and fast, for rock), Electronic (for dance music) or Loud (the most). Choosing one sets its Compression, Texture and Output. | Mixer › Master › Compressor type | — | — |
| **Master editor** | Opens the Master Compressor's parameters and the Master EQ's eight bands. | Mixer › Master › Edit | — | — |
| **Compression** | How much the compressor squeezes: more lowers its threshold and raises its ratio together. 0% compresses nothing. | Master Compressor › Compression | — | — |
| **Texture** | How light the compressor feels: higher reacts and lets go faster, lower is heavier and smoother. | Master Compressor › Texture | — | — |
| **Compressor output** | The level after the compressor, in dB (−12 to +12), to make up what it takes away. The output's safety clipper still catches anything above −1 dBFS. | Master Compressor › Output | — | — |
| **Master EQ** | An eight-band EQ on the whole mix, the final tone control before the output. Lit, it plays (not on the metronome); off, the mix is untouched. It stays as set until you change it, even after a restart. | Mixer › Master › EQ | — | — |
| **Master EQ type** | A starting shape for the eight bands: Flat (all 0 dB), Mellow (the highs a little down), Bright (the highs up), Loudness (the lows and highs up) or Powerful (everything up a little). Choosing one sets every band. | Mixer › Master › EQ type | — | — |
| **EQ band gain** | Boosts or cuts this band, −12 to +12 dB. At 0 dB the band is out of the signal. | Master EQ › Gain | — | — |
| **EQ band frequency** | The band's centre frequency in Hz (a shelf's corner): 32–2000 for the lowest band, 100–10000 for the middle six, 500–16000 for the highest. | Master EQ › Frequency | — | — |
| **EQ band Q** | The band's width, 0.1 to 12.0: higher is narrower. A shelf has none. | Master EQ › Q | — | — |
| **EQ band shelf** | The lowest and highest bands only: lit, the band is a shelf, boosting or cutting everything below (above) its frequency; off, a peak or dip around it. | Master EQ › Peak/Dip, Shelving | — | — |
| **Band reverb** | How much of the band (the eight Style parts) goes to the reverb: each Style part's own reverb send (CC 91) times this, in the built-in synth only. 100% plays the reverb the style wrote and 0% is none; your keyboard parts keep their own sends. | Mixer › Style › Effect › Reverb (all parts) | — | — |
| **Band chorus** | How much of the band (the eight Style parts) goes to the chorus: each Style part's own chorus send (CC 93) times this, in the built-in synth only. 0% at start, so the chorus is for your keyboard parts; 100% plays the chorus the style wrote. | Mixer › Style › Effect › Chorus (all parts) | — | — |
| **Band delay** | How much of the band (the eight Style parts) goes to the tempo delay: each Style part's own variation send (CC 94) times this, in the built-in synth only. 0% at start, because a style's CC 94 was meant for its own Variation effect, not this delay; turn it up to echo the band. | Mixer › Style › Effect › Variation (all parts) | — | — |

| **Metronome settings** | The metronome's settings (the click's volume and the bell on beat 1) will open here in a popover; for now the caret does nothing. | Menu › Metronome | — | — |

## Style Dynamics

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dynamics Control** | On: the Dynamics level (and Touch) can change how hard the band plays. Off: the Style plays exactly as written. | Menu › Style Setting › Dynamics Control | — | — |
| **Dynamics** | How hard the whole band plays, 0–127; it starts at the maximum, 127, which plays the Style as written, and goes back there with each new style. Turning it down lowers every Style note's velocity, so the drums and instruments get softer and darker, not just quieter. The mixer volumes stay as they are. | Live Control › Style Dynamics (DynCtrl) | — | Knob 1 on the Style knob page |
| **Touch** | The band follows your left hand. Each key you strike in the chord section sets the Dynamics level from how hard you hit it, and a strike at velocity 100 or harder plays the Style as written. | — | `&` | — |
| **Accent** | Strike a key at least as hard as the threshold for an accent: with Mode Hits, a drum hit from the Style's kit, with the style stopped or playing; with Mode Fill, while a Main plays, the Main's own fill from the next beat. Source picks which hand accents. | — | `Shift+H` | — |
| **Accent threshold** | How hard (velocity 1–127) a strike must be to accent. The default is 110. | — | — | — |
| **Accent mode: Hits** | Each accent plays a one-shot hit from the Style's drum kit, stopped or playing: kick + closed hat, kick + snare when harder, kick + crash from velocity 120. The hit is as loud as you strike. The default. | — | — | — |
| **Accent mode: Fill** | While a Main plays, an accent plays that Main's own fill from the next beat (as Fill Self; OTS Link does not follow it). With the style stopped, accents play drum hits. | — | — | — |
| **Accent source: Left** | Only chord-section strikes accent. The default. | — | — | — |
| **Accent source: Both** | Chord-section and right-hand strikes both accent. | — | — | — |
| **More accent settings** | Shows or hides the accent mode (Hits: a drum hit; Fill: the Main’s fill while it plays) and its source (Left: chord-section strikes; Both: right-hand strikes too). | — | — | — |

## Knob Assign pages

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Knob Assign page** | What the eight Launchkey knobs do, on six pages. Style has Dynamics, Retrigger length and on/off, Style Track Mute A and B and tempo; Rack has whatever the loaded rack's controller map says (the Rack panel sets it; by default the keyboard parts' volumes, Harmony and metronome volume and tempo); Pan has the parts' pan, the effect returns and tempo; Reverb, Chorus and Delay each have Right 1, Right 2, Right 3 and Left's send to that effect on knobs 1–4, then the effect's own settings and its return on knob 8: Reverb time, pre-delay and tone; Chorus rate and depth; Delay time, feedback and tone. Turning an effect setting keeps that effect as yours through style changes (its Style switch goes off). | KNOB ASSIGN | — | ▲ / ▼ right of the knobs |
| **Knob** | Turns what the knob has on the Knob Assign page, from where it is now: levels 2 a step, tempo 1 BPM, Retrigger every 3 steps. Drag up or down to turn it (Shift for fine), use the mouse wheel, or focus it and press the arrow keys; double-click puts it back to its default (Dynamics max, sends dry, pan centre, Tempo the style's). The knobs are endless like the Launchkey's: with no level to show, the pointer shows the last movement. | LIVE CONTROL knobs | — | The eight knobs |

## Chord Looper

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Chord Looper REC/STOP** | Records the chords you play, from the next bar line; stopped, it arms Sync Start and your first chord starts the band and the recording together. Press again to stop recording while the band plays on. | CHORD LOOPER [REC/STOP] | `R` | Panel fader page: Shift + button under fader 8 (red while recording) |
| **Chord Looper ON/OFF** | Loops the recorded chords from the next bar line, feeding them to the band as if you played them, so both hands are free. While it loops your chords are ignored; press again to stop it at once. A long press is Loop rec: it records the chords you play from the next bar line. | CHORD LOOPER [ON/OFF] | `^` | Panel fader page: button under fader 8 (green while looping) |
| **Chord Looper memory** | One of eight memories. Selecting one that holds a sequence makes it the loop; while looping it takes over at the next bar line. | Chord Looper › Memory 1–8 | — | — |
| **Memory** | Stores the current sequence: press it, then a memory number. The memory is named CLD_001 and on. | Chord Looper › [Memory] | — | — |
| **Clear** | Empties a memory: press it, then a memory number. | Chord Looper › [Clear] | — | — |
| **New bank** | Empties all eight memories: a new bank with no file yet. The current sequence stays. | Chord Looper › New Bank | — | — |
| **Chord Looper bank** | The bank of eight memories in use. Pick a bank file to load its memories. Every change to the memories saves itself (a bank with no file is kept until next time too), and the next session starts with this bank. | Chord Looper › bank (.clb) | — | — |
| **Bank name** | Type a name, then Save, to save the eight memories as a new bank file. | Chord Looper › Save | — | — |
| **Save bank** | Saves the memories to the bank's file, or under the name you typed as a new file. If another bank already has that name, nothing is saved: pick another name, or use Overwrite. | Chord Looper › Save | — | — |
| **Overwrite bank** | Another Chord Looper bank has the name you typed: replace its file with these memories. | Chord Looper › Save (overwrite) | — | — |
| **The sequence** | The chords the loop plays, bar by bar; the bar playing is lit. Chord times snap to 16th notes and the loop is whole bars. | Chord Looper (current data) | — | — |
| **Load bank** | Lists the bank files in the ChordLooper folder; pick one to load its eight memories in place of these. The bank in use is the white block. Esc closes the list. | Chord Looper › Open | — | — |
| **Save as…** | Saves the eight memories as a bank file under a name you type. Enter saves, Esc cancels; left empty, the bank keeps its own name. | Chord Looper › Save | — | — |
| **Cancel** | Closes the name field without saving. | — | — | — |

## Sound library

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **GM map** | The drums and all 128 GM programs by family: each rule, the sound each program plays now and which layer decided it. The number counts the programs still on auto. | — | — | — |
| **Deciding layer** | Which rule decided what this program plays: Drums, Override, Family, or Auto (the best preset in your SoundFonts, nobody chose it). "Style" marks this style's own rule. | — | — | — |
| **Add from SoundFont** | Browse the presets of the SoundFonts in the SoundFont folder, audition one, and add it as a patch. | — | — | — |
| **Search** | Shows only the patches whose name, category or tags contain the text. | — | — | — |
| **Category** | Shows one category of patches, like the tabs of the Genos Voice Selection display. All shows every patch. | Voice category tabs | — | — |

| **Patch** | Selects the patch to edit it below. A dimmed patch plays the SoundFont fallback; its note says why. | — | — | — |
| **Favourite** | Marks or unmarks the patch as a favourite. | Favorite | — | — |
| **Audition** | Plays the sound on its own for a moment: a short arpeggio and a chord, or a beat for a drum kit. Works while the band is stopped. A plugin patch loads its plugin first. | — | — | — |

| **Save part's sound** | Saves a keyboard part's sound as a new patch (Save as…): its plugin with its current settings, its own patch, or its GM voice on the synth's SoundFont, with its volume and octave. | — | — | — |
| **Global / this style** | Which map the rules edit: the global one every style uses, or this style's own rules, which win over it. This style's map is kept in your library, not in the style file. | — | — | — |
| **Family rule** | The sound these eight GM programs play, with every bank variation of them. Click to pick one from Sounds: any SoundFont preset or plugin sound. Blank: the program falls through to auto, the best preset in your SoundFonts. | — | — | — |
| **Clear rule** | Clears this rule: the programs it covered play what the next layer gives them: the family rule, the global map, or auto. | — | — | — |

| **Clear this style's rules** | Forgets this style's own rules: it plays by the map every style uses. | — | — | — |
| **Port sends mapped programs** | Off, the yahaha MIDI port carries the style's own program changes, so a DAW records the style as written. On, it carries the mapped patch's bank and program instead. | — | — | — |

| **Search presets** | Shows only the presets whose name contains the text. | — | — | — |
| **Preset** | Plays the preset on its own for a moment, while the band is stopped. | — | — | — |
| **Add as patch** | Adds the preset to your library as a patch, named after it and filed under its likely category. | — | — | — |
| **Export** | Writes your library and GM map as a bundle (sound-library-export.json in the data folder): every sound's name, category and settings, plugin sounds' states included. SoundFonts are named by file, not copied: copy them yourself. | — | — | — |
| **Export .aupreset** | Writes this plugin sound as a standard .aupreset in ~/Library/Audio/Presets, under its plugin, so Logic and MainStage can load it. | — | — | — |
| **Replace** | Replaces the plugin's existing preset of this name with this sound. Logic and MainStage see the new one too. | — | — | — |
| **Keep the existing preset** | Leaves the existing preset as it is; rename the sound to export it as a new one. | — | — | — |
| **Library file** | The path of a sound library file to import: a full library, or a list of patches. | — | — | — |
| **Import** | Adds a bundle's (or library file's) sounds to your library, clashing ids getting new ones, and its map rules too; nothing you have is replaced. SoundFonts are found by file name in your SoundFont folder; any that are missing are listed, and their sounds are kept for when you add the files. | — | — | — |
| **Sound number** | Each sound in the Library has a number: what swap mode dials and the Launchkey display shows (R1: 23 Rhodes Soft). The numbers stay put while the Library is unchanged. | — | — | Swap mode: knob 1 steps through them |

| **Rotary Fast** | The rotary speaker's Fast/Slow switch: lit while every rotary insert spins fast, dark while slow; each click switches it. The horn and drum change speed gradually, as a real rotary speaker does. An assignable pedal set to "Organ Rotary Slow/Fast" does the same. | Organ Rotary Slow/Fast | — | Shift + encoder page ▲ |
| **Launchkey** | Whether the Launchkey is connected in DAW mode, so its pads and buttons are arranger controls. | — | — | — |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Keyboard** | The keys you are holding, coloured by the part that sounds them: Right 1–3 above the split, Left below it, grey where a key only feeds chord detection. The shaded band is where chord detection listens, and dots mark the tones of the recognised chord, the ringed one its bass. The engine doesn't report held keys or chord tones yet; until it does, the strip shows only the split and the detection area. | Keyboard (Split Point, chord detection area) | — | The Launchkey's keys |
| **Split point** | Where the left-hand section ends (C3 = middle C). Drag the marker, or focus it and use the arrow keys, to move it one key at a time. | Split Point (Style + Left) | `[` `]` | Pad page 3 (Chord), bottom row, pad 3 and 4 |

## Settings

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| **Settings** | Chord detection, split, transpose, style behaviour, audio, MIDI and the style library. Changes apply at once. | — | — | — |
| **Close settings** | Closes the settings panel. | — | `Esc` | — |
| **Settings: Chord & Split** | Fingering type, chord detection area (Lower or Upper), Manual Bass and the split point. Also on the Launchkey's Chord and Setup pad pages. | Menu › Split & Fingering | — | Pad page 5 (Setup), top row (fingering, Upper); Pad page 3 (Chord), bottom row, pad 1 (Manual Bass) |

| **Settings: Transpose** | Keyboard and Master transpose, in semitones. | Menu › Transpose | — | Pad page 3 (Chord), bottom row, pads 5–7 |
| **Settings: Style** | How the band starts, stops and fills: Sync Start/Stop, Auto Fill and Stop Accompaniment. Also on the Knobs' Style page. | Menu › Style Setting | — | Pad page 1 (Sections) (Sync Start, Sync Stop, Auto Fill); Pad page 3 (Chord), bottom row, pad 2 (Stop ACMP); Pad page 5 (Setup), bottom row, pads 2–3 (Stop ACMP mode) |
| **Settings: Parameter Lock** | Lock the split point or the fingering type, so rack and One Touch Setting recalls leave them as you set them. | Menu › Utility › Parameter Lock | — | — |
| **Settings: Audio** | The built-in synth: on or off, which output pair it plays on, its SoundFont and its master volume. | — | — | — |
| **Settings: MIDI** | Which MIDI inputs play yahaha, the yahaha output port, and the Launchkey connection. | Menu › MIDI | — | — |
| **Settings: Library** | The folders yahaha looks for style files in, and a rescan. | Style selection (USB / User folders) | — | — |
| **Split point** | Drag the white line on the keys to move the split, black keys included, or click it and then click the key it goes on (Esc cancels); a locked split point stays put. Keys at and below it are Left and the chord section, keys above it play Right 1–3 (C3 = middle C). With focus, ←/→ move it a key, PgUp/PgDn an octave, Enter arms the pick. | Split Point (Style + Left) | `[` `]` | Pad page 3 (Chord), bottom row, pads 3–4 |
| **Section change timing: to Main** | When a Main you press (or a style you load while a Main plays) takes over; a style loaded during an Ending waits for it to end. Next Bar: at once if you press within the bar's first beat, otherwise at the next bar line. Immediate: at the next beat, carrying on from that beat, except with Auto Fill on, where a Main change is always Next Bar. | Section Change Timing – To Main [A]–[D] | — | — |
| **Section change timing: inside Intro/Ending** | When you switch to another Intro or Ending while one plays. Next Bar: as for Mains. End of Section: the one playing finishes first, except Intro to Intro (Next Bar) and anything into Ending I (the next bar line). | Section Change Timing – Inside Intro/Ending | — | — |
| **OTS Link timing** | With OTS Link on and the band playing: At Main Section Change (the default) swaps your sounds when the Main you pressed starts (after its fill, if any), never while the old section still plays; Immediate swaps them the moment you press it. A new style's sounds come when that style takes over. Stopped, both swap at once. | OTS Link Timing | — | — |
| **Stop Accompaniment: Off** | A chord you play with the band stopped (Sync Start off) is recognised and shown, but doesn't sound. | Stop ACMP: Off | — | — |
| **Stop Accompaniment: Style** | A chord you play with the band stopped (Sync Start off) sounds on the style's own Bass and Pad voices. | Stop ACMP: Style | — | Pad page 5 (Setup), bottom row, pad 2 (ACMP STYLE) |
| **Stop Accompaniment: Fixed** | A chord you play with the band stopped (Sync Start off) sounds on a fixed Finger Bass and Warm Pad, whatever the style. The style's own voices come back when the band starts. | Stop ACMP: Fixed | — | Pad page 5 (Setup), bottom row, pad 3 (ACMP FIXED) |
| **Tempo on style change** | What choosing another style does to the tempo. Lock always keeps it, Hold keeps it only while the band plays, and Reset always takes the new style's. | Change Behavior: Tempo | — | — |
| **Part on/off on style change** | What choosing another style does to the style parts you muted. Lock keeps them muted, Hold keeps them muted only while the band plays, and Reset turns every part back on. | Change Behavior: Part On/Off | — | — |
| **Section on style change** | The Main a style you choose while stopped starts on (the nearest one it has), or Off to keep the Main you had. | Change Behavior: Section Set | — | — |
| **Chord settle** | How long a new chord must hold still before the style follows it (0–30 ms; 0 follows every change at once). A chord whose keys land a few ms apart is then one chord change, not two, so no note is struck on the passing chord and cut a moment later. Only the accompaniment's chord parts wait (also Stop Accompaniment, and Multi Pads with Chord Match, even with the style stopped), and only when you change the chord on or just before their notes; drums keep time, and a chord struck a little ahead of the beat costs nothing. | — | — | — |
| **Lock Split Point** | On: the split point stays where you set it. Loading a rack or a One Touch Setting leaves it alone, and the split line on the keyboard can't be dragged or picked; you can still step it with − and + on the Chord & Split page. | Parameter Lock: Split Point | — | — |
| **Lock Fingering Type** | On: the fingering type and the Chord Detection Area (Upper, Manual Bass) stay as you set them. Loading a rack or a One Touch Setting leaves them alone; you can still change them yourself. | Parameter Lock: Fingering Type | — | — |
| **Synchro Stop window** | With Sync Stop on: hold a chord longer than this and Sync Stop turns itself off, so the style keeps playing when you let go. A quicker release still stops the style. Off (all the way left): Sync Stop never turns itself off. | Synchro Stop Window | — | — |
| **Fade in time** | How long a fade in takes to reach full volume, from 0 to 20 seconds. | Fade In Time | — | — |
| **Fade out time** | How long a fade out takes to reach silence before the band stops, from 0 to 20 seconds. | Fade Out Time | — | — |
| **Fade out hold time** | How long the style stays silent after a fade out before its volume comes back, from 0 to 5 seconds. | Fade Out Hold Time | — | — |
| **Written tempo changes** | Plays the tempo changes a style writes inside its sections, mostly the slow-downs at the end of Endings and Intros, scaled to the tempo you play at. The tempo comes back when the section ends or the band stops. | — | — | — |
| **Tap: Section Reset** | On (the default, as on the Genos): Tap while the band plays restarts the section from its top and keeps the tempo. Off: Tap always sets the tempo. | Tap Tempo › Style Section Reset | — | — |
| **Retrigger length** | How much of the Main's start Retrigger loops: a whole note (1) down to a 32nd (1/32). | Style Retrigger Rate (RtgRate) | — | Shift + > (Scene Launch) / Shift + Function buttons |
| **Style folders** | The folders yahaha reads style files from (.sty, .prs, .sst and more), with subfolders as categories. Pass them on the command line or set YAHAHA_STYLES. | Style selection (User / USB) | — | — |
| **Rescan styles** | Reads the style folders again, picking up files you added, changed or removed. The band keeps playing. | — | — | — |
| **Pedals and wheels** | The sustain pedal and footswitches, what each pedal does, and which parts the pedal and the wheels reach. P1 is the Launchkey's pedal jack; P2 and P3 come from any MIDI input. | Assignable, Controller | — | — |
| **Pad page order** | Which pad pages Pad Bank ▲/▼ step through after Sections, and in what order. Leave a page out to skip it; hold Sound still shows Racks. Kept in your settings. | — | — | Pad Bank ▲ / ▼ follow it |
| **Settings: Controller** | The Launchkey's pad page order: which pad pages Pad Bank ▲/▼ step through after Sections, and in what order. | — | — | Pad Bank ▲ / ▼ follow the order |
| **Move page up** | Moves this pad page one place earlier in the order, so Pad Bank ▼ reaches it sooner. Kept in your settings. | — | — | — |
| **Move page down** | Moves this pad page one place later in the order. Kept in your settings. | — | — | — |
| **Leave page out** | Takes this pad page out of the order: Pad Bank ▲/▼ and Tab skip it. If the pads are showing it, they go back to Sections. Hold Sound still shows Racks. | — | — | — |
| **Add page back** | Puts a pad page you left out back into the order, last. | — | — | — |
| **Default page order** | Puts every pad page back in the default order: Sections, Racks, Chord, Multi Pads, Setup. | — | — | — |
| **Settings: Keyboard** | Keyboard and Master transpose, and the parameter locks that keep the split point and the fingering type when you recall a Quick Rack or a One Touch Setting. | Menu › Transpose, Utility › Parameter Lock | — | Pad page 3 (Chord), bottom row (Kbd Tr −, Kbd Tr +, Tr Reset) |
| **Settings: System** | Audio (the built-in synth, the output pair, the buffer, master volume), MIDI (which inputs yahaha listens to, its output, the Launchkey LEDs), the style folders and SoundFonts, and the theme. | — | — | — |
| **Reset split point** | Puts the split point back at the default, F#2. Nothing to reset while it is there. | — | — | — |
| **Set split on the keys** | Arms a pick: the next key you click on the keyboard at the foot of the screen becomes the split point, black keys included. Click again or press Esc to cancel. You can also drag the white split line there, unless the split point is locked. | Split Point (Style + Left) | — | — |
| **Split point lock** | A locked split point stays where it is when you recall a Quick Rack or a One Touch Setting, and the split line on the keyboard stays put; − and + here still move it. Opens the Keyboard page, where the lock is switched. | Parameter Lock | — | — |
| **Shown** | Lit: Pad Bank ▲/▼ steps through this pad page. Off: the page is left out and Pad Bank skips it; switch it back on and it goes last. Hold Sound still shows Racks. | — | — | Pad Bank ▲ / ▼ follow the order |

## Audio

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Audio output** | The output pair the built-in synth plays on. `--audio-out N` sets it at launch. | — | `A` | — |
| **Audio buffer** | Frames the built-in synth renders at a time: 64 (1.3 ms at 48 kHz) feels tightest; 128 or 256 give heavy plugins and a busy computer more time per block, and 512 (10.7 ms) or 1024 (21.3 ms) stop stubborn dropouts at a latency you will feel. Changing it reopens the output with a moment of silence; held notes and plugins carry over. It is remembered, and `--buffer N` sets it at launch. | — | — | — |
| **Audio dropouts** | The audio device missed buffers several times in a short while: clicks or gaps in the sound, from a heavy plugin, a busy computer or a buffer too small for either. Opens Settings › Audio, where a larger buffer size gives each block more time, at a little more latency. | — | — | — |
| **Dismiss** | Hides the dropout notice for ten minutes. Choosing a new buffer size also clears it. | — | — | — |
| **Mute synth** | Silences the built-in synth, for when you play Ableton's sounds from the yahaha MIDI port instead. | — | `K` | — |
| **Built-in synth** | Turns the built-in SoundFont synth's sound on or off. The yahaha MIDI port keeps playing either way, for Ableton or other sounds. | — | `K` | — |

## MIDI

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MIDI input** | Whether this MIDI source plays yahaha. The Launchkey's DAW port carries its pads and buttons. | — | — | — |
| **Inputs: all or selected** | All: every MIDI source plays yahaha, merged. Selected: only the sources you switch on below. `--all-inputs` and `--input name` set it at launch. | — | — | — |
| **yahaha MIDI output** | The virtual MIDI port yahaha plays the band and your parts on. Pick it as a MIDI input in Ableton to use your own sounds. | MIDI Transmit | — | — |
| **Palette LEDs** | Lights the Launchkey with its built-in palette colours and hardware flashing instead of exact RGB colours. Try it if the pads look wrong or lag. `--palette-leds` sets it at launch. | — | — | Every pad and button light |

## Pedals and wheels

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pedal function** | What this pedal does: Sustain (or Sostenuto, Soft), a style control such as Start/Stop, Fill Up or Break, an OTS, a Quick Rack, tempo, transpose or a part on/off. | Assignable › Foot Pedal | — | The pedal plugged into the sustain jack |
| **Pedal CC** | The control change this pedal listens for on the keyboards: the Launchkey's sustain jack sends CC 64. Clear it and the pedal listens to nothing. Bank select (0, 32), the modulation wheel (1), data entry (6, 38), volume (7), (N)RPN (98-101) and the channel mode messages (120-127) can't be used. | — | — | The sustain jack (CC 64) |
| **Learn** | Press this, then the pedal: it takes that pedal's CC. Press again to stop waiting. | — | — | The sustain jack (CC 64) |
| **Try** | Runs the pedal's function now, as a press would. Sustain, Sostenuto and Soft switch on or off, and stay that way until you press Try again. Modulation and Pitch Bend follow the pedal, so there is nothing to try here. | — | — | — |
| **Reverse polarity** | For a pedal that works the wrong way round (nothing when pressed, something when let go). | Polarity | — | — |
| **Hold A** | On while the pedal is held, off when it is let go: how a sustain pedal works. | Control Type: Hold A | — | — |
| **Hold B** | Off while the pedal is held, on when it is up: picking it with the pedal up turns the function on at once. | Control Type: Hold B | — | — |
| **Toggle** | Each press switches it on or off. | Control Type: Toggle | — | — |
| **Bend up** | An expression pedal bends the pitch up: heel down is no bend, toe down the full Pitch Bend Range. | Range: Upper | — | — |
| **Bend down** | An expression pedal bends the pitch down: heel down is no bend, toe down the full range down. | Range: Lower | — | — |
| **Bend both ways** | The pedal sweeps the whole bend: heel down is fully down, the middle no bend, toe down fully up. | Range: Full | — | — |
| **Sustain on this part** | Whether the sustain pedal (and Sostenuto and Soft) reach this part. A part only takes it while it is on. | Sustain (part settings) | — | — |
| **Pitch bend on this part** | Whether the pitch-bend wheel (or a Pitch Bend pedal) bends this part. | Joystick (X): Pitch Bend | — | The pitch wheel |
| **Modulation on this part** | Whether the modulation wheel adds vibrato to this part. By default Right 1–3 take it and Left doesn't. | Joystick (Y): Modulation | — | The modulation wheel |
| **Pitch Bend Range down** | One semitone less bend for this part (0–12; 2 is the default). | Pitch Bend Range | — | — |
| **Pitch Bend Range up** | One semitone more bend for this part (0–12). | Pitch Bend Range | — | — |
| **Control type** | How a switch function follows the pedal, for switch functions only: Hold A and Hold B (the Genos’ two hold styles) are on while held; Toggle switches it on or off with each press. | Control Type | — | — |
| **Pitch bend range** | Which way a Pitch Bend pedal bends: Upper up only, Lower down only, Full down at rest and up when pressed. Only for Pitch Bend. | Range | — | — |

## App

| control | what it does | Genos | key | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Audio health** | How the audio is doing: "Audio" when all is well, "Audio off" when the built-in synth isn't running. A keyboard part whose plugin failed ("R3 failed") opens its Channel when clicked. Dropouts in the last 30 seconds ("2 dropouts", with "buffer 256?" when the buffer is under 1024) or the synth's CPU at 70% or more ("CPU 74%") open the audio settings, where a larger buffer gives each block more time. | — | — | — |
| **Help mode** | Keeps the last control you hovered or tabbed to in the status line above the keys while you try it, instead of the line going back to its message. Controls keep working. | — | `?` | — |
| **Light / dark** | Switches between the dark stage theme and a light one. | — | — | — |

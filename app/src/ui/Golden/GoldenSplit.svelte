<!--
  GoldenSplit: one cut. It takes a part off one side of its box (`from`): a square (as deep as the
  box is across), the golden section's `major` (61.8 % of the length) or `minor` (38.2 %), or a
  strip in an interval (as deep as the box is across over the interval). Two children: the part
  taken, then the rest. A square taken off a box that is too short for it overflows, and the
  overlay draws it red.
  `spiralFrom` and `spiralTurn` orient the spiral the overlay draws in this split (so its pole sits
  on the page's focus): a `major`/`minor` split's spiral otherwise starts from `from` and turns ccw,
  and with `spiralFrom` set any split gets a spiral, whatever it takes. They change nothing in the
  layout.

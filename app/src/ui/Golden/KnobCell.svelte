<!--
  KnobCell: one band knob as a Golden tree that fills the slot it is given (no fit to a shape, so
  no spare). The dial grows to fill its cell: its tree is two label-height bands off the foot (a
  line of text is a fixed token) and the dial in everything they leave:
    GoldenBand label-height, bottom → [name, GoldenBand label-height, bottom → [value, dial]]
  - the dial: the real Knob drawn as its ring alone, as big as the rest allows (its height, or its
    width less a fib-3 gutter, whichever is smaller), centred across, standing on the value;
  - the value, tight under the dial; the name under it.
  One line each: when the full name doesn't fit its cell (measured once the cell has a size), the
  knob's short code ("RtgRate") is shown instead and the full name goes in the title (the tooltip);
  a name is never cut short while its code fits. With `lines={2}` the name's band is two lines
  deep and a long name wraps onto the second line (the same 13px size); the code only when two
  lines don't hold it (the golden Stage: a readable name over a cryptic code). With `valueInside`
  the value sits in the ring's hollow and the dial takes its band:
    GoldenBand label-lines-2 (or label-height), bottom → [name, dial with the value inside]
  With `shorten="word"` the stand-in for a name that doesn't fit is a human short name, its first
  word ("Retrig"), never the code (the golden Stage).
  Inside a grid fitted to a cell shape, the grid sizes it. On its own (outside any Golden slot) it
  takes the size the Stage gives one knob cell.

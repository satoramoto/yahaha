# WaitingChip

> **Superseded look (Round 2 restyle, PR #550).** The outline is gone. The chip is plain text in
> the hue: no border, no padding, transparent. `hue: 't'` (the default) draws in `--m`, the muted
> grey of Round 2's next section; any other hue draws in its own token. `display` is 44 tall
> (`--chip-height-display`), `--text-28` light with `--tracking-28`; `count` and `line` keep their
> type and drop the 8px side padding. The line-height is the chip's height. Where it is used: only
> StyleLine mounts it, at `line` with `hue="a"` (the queued style). The count row is gone (its
> count moved into the display's `BarBeat` row), and the display's next section is NowPlaying's own
> text, so no screen uses `count` or `display` today. Where the sections below disagree, this note wins.

## Identity (all stations)

- **Kind:** primitive
- **Built from:** —
- **Purpose:** Names what comes next (the next section, a style waiting for the bar line) in an outline, so it reads as "coming" rather than "playing".
- **Boards:**
  - `Stage-Dark.dc.html:110` (the old count row's next section "Main C", 26 tall, 18px; the count row is now gone), `:166` (the display's next section "Main C", 48 tall, 36px); light: `Stage-Light.dc.html:86`, `:142`.
  - The `line` size (the style line's queued style) is drawn on no board; its values are Stage.md › Style line, "Queued style".
- **Not this component's job:** no store, no API, no Tauri. Not a control: it has no click, focus or tooltip. It doesn't decide what is next, map a section name to its Genos name or to a hue (kit › Section names, Hue roles: the parent passes `label` and `hue`), or hide itself from screen readers (a parent that wants it hidden wraps it in `aria-hidden`). Not the waiting face of a button or a pad (Fade armed, Looper armed, a queued pad): those are Button, LampButton and Pad.

## API (Component station)

### Props

Every prop gets a JSDoc comment in the component.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `label` | `string` | — | The text in the outline: a section's shown name ("Main C", "Intro II", "Break") or a style's name, drawn as given (not trimmed). Empty or only whitespace (`label.trim() === ''`): nothing is rendered (no empty outline, D7). |
| `hue` | `'intro' \| 'main' \| 'ending' \| 'brk' \| 'fill' \| 'a' \| 't'` | `'t'` | The kit hue role of the border and the text: a section hue for a section, `a` for a queued style (the accent), `t` for a neutral waiting chip (kit › Faces, "or `--t`"). |
| `size` | `'count' \| 'line' \| 'display'` | `'count'` | `count`: 26 tall, 18px light, padding 0 8 (the count row). `line`: 26 tall, 14px regular, padding 0 8, at most 200 wide with an ellipsis (the style line's queued style). `display`: 48 tall, 36px light, letter-spacing −1, padding 0 10 (the display's next section). |

### Visual rules

- **Tokens used:** `--intro`, `--main`, `--ending`, `--brk`, `--fill`, `--a`, `--t`, `--radius`, `--line-width`, `--font-sans`, `--text-14`, `--text-18`, `--text-36`, `--weight-light`, `--weight-regular`, `--space-8`, `--space-10`, and the new tokens below.

#### New tokens

Not in `app/src/ui/tokens/*` today. They land in the orchestrator's tokens contract PR before this component is built; the builder uses them by name and never hard-codes the value (L1, L2).

| Token | Dark | Light | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--chip-height` | `26px` | `26px` | the chip's height at `count` and `line` (scale.css) |
| `--chip-height-display` | `48px` | `48px` | the chip's height at `display` (scale.css) |
| `--chip-max` | `200px` | `200px` | the `line` chip's maximum width, border included (scale.css) |
| `--tracking-36` | `-1px` | `-1px` | letter-spacing of 36px light text (scale.css) |
| `--main` (changed, Stage C6) | unchanged (`--green-400` #4fd66a) | #1c8040 → **#19733a** (on `--g` 4.42 → 5.23; on `--btn` 4.60) | the Main hue's text on the ground; the light palette entry `--green-700` changes, so light `--ok` moves with it |
| `--intro` (changed, Stage C6) | unchanged (`--gold-400` #bfb24e) | #857a1f → **#6e651a** (3.87 → 5.25; on `--btn` 4.62) | the Intro hue's text on the ground; light `--gold-700` changes |
| `--brk` (changed, Stage C6) | #8f62a8 → **#986faf** (on black 4.48 → 5.23; on `--btn` 4.50) | unchanged (`--plum-600` #7a4a96) | the Break hue's text on the ground; dark `--plum-400` changes |

These are Stage.md C6's values, not this spec's own: C6 picks, per palette entry, the smallest HSL-lightness step that passes every pair the kit draws (on `--g`, on `--btn` and under `--solid-ink`), and the same entries feed `--ok`, the legend and the pads, so every spec uses C6's one value (D11). C6 also changes dark `--ending` (#c66060) and light `--fill` (#476b76); both already pass on `--g` and stay passing.

- **Element:** a `<span>`, `display: inline-block`, `box-sizing: border-box`, `white-space: nowrap`, `vertical-align: middle`. `count` and `display`: `flex: none`. `line`: `flex: 0 1 auto`, `min-width: 0`, `max-width: var(--chip-max)`, `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`. The `flex` values matter only when the parent is a flex container (the flex item is blockified, so `inline-block` is ignored there): in StyleLine's flex row a crowded line can shrink the `line` chip below its 200px cap and it ellipsizes at whatever width it gets. In a block or inline parent (the stories' centred root) `flex` does nothing: the chip is as wide as its label, at most 200px (D8).
- **Face (every size):** transparent background; border `--line-width` solid in the hue (`var(--<hue>)`); radius `--radius` (4); text in the hue. No glow, no fill, no bar.
- **Size:**

  | Size | Height | Padding (top/bottom 0) | Line-height | Type | Letter-spacing | Width |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | `count` | `--chip-height` (26) | `--space-8` each side | `calc(var(--chip-height) - 2 * var(--line-width))` (24) | `--text-18`, `--weight-light` (300) | 0 | the label; never truncated |
  | `line` | `--chip-height` (26) | `--space-8` each side | 24 (as `count`) | `--text-14`, `--weight-regular` (400) | 0 | the label, at most `--chip-max` (200, border included); longer: `overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis` |
  | `display` | `--chip-height-display` (48) | `--space-10` each side | `calc(var(--chip-height-display) - 2 * var(--line-width))` (46) | `--text-36`, `--weight-light` (300) | `--tracking-36` (−1px) | the label; never truncated |

  Measured on the board: "Main C" at `count` is 75 × 26, at `display` 130 × 48.
- **States drawn by:** one face; the hue is the only thing that changes. Empty or whitespace-only `label`: no element at all (the component renders nothing, not even a wrapper).
- **Type:** DM Sans (`--font-sans`), tabular numerals, the label as given (no case change).
- **Test hooks:** the span carries `data-face="waiting"`, `data-hue="<hue>"` (`main`, `a` …) and `data-size="<size>"`.
- **Contrast (AA, `tokens/contrast.test.ts`):** the text is drawn on the ground through the transparent face, so the pairs are each hue on `--g`, at 4.5:1 (the `count` and `line` sizes are normal text: 18px light and 14px). Existing row: `--t` on `--g`. New rows (land with the tokens contract PR, L1), each "section or accent hue text on the ground (WaitingChip, GroupHeader legend)": `--intro`, `--main`, `--ending`, `--brk`, `--fill`, `--a` on `--g`. Today's ratios, dark / light: `--intro` 9.69 / **3.87**, `--main` 11.16 / **4.42**, `--ending` 4.96 / 5.20, `--brk` **4.48** / 5.73, `--fill` 7.27 / 4.51, `--a` 7.80 / 5.95. The three in bold fail; Stage C6's values under New tokens fix them (D4, D11, L2). C6 itself adds the hue rows on `--g` and on `--btn`, so these rows are C6's. `display` (36px, large text) needs only 3:1, which all pass today.
- **Not checkable in jsdom:** the border and text colour (a custom property per hue), the sizes and the ellipsis; the `Board` and `Display` crops and the `LongStyle` story (judged by Inspect) cover them.
- **Motion:** none.

### Accessibility

- **Role and name:** none: a plain `<span>` whose text is read in place. No `aria-label`, no role, not focusable. When ellipsized (`line`), the full label is still the span's text, so assistive tech reads it whole.
- **Keyboard:** none.
- **Tooltip id:** none (not a control; the parent's readout carries its own, e.g. StyleLine's).

## Stories (Story station)

Title `Primitives/WaitingChip`, `layout: 'centered'`. Every story renders in dark and light (the toolbar theme).

| Story | Args | Shows | Crop | Play (interaction check) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Board` | `{ label: 'Main C', hue: 'main', size: 'count' }` | an 18px light green "Main C", no outline | `Board-{dark,light}.png` (Stage 667,71 75×26; cut from the old outlined board, so it no longer matches) | the text "Main C" is in a span with `data-face="waiting"`, `data-hue="main"`, `data-size="count"`; no `button`, no focusable element |
| `Display` | `{ label: 'Main C', hue: 't', size: 'display' }` | Round 2's next section: a 28px light, muted "Main C" | `Display-{dark,light}.png` (Stage 557,191 130×48; cut from the old outlined board, so it no longer matches) | — |
| `QueuedStyle` | `{ label: 'Coastal Highway', hue: 'a', size: 'line' }` | the style line's queued style in the accent | — (no board draws a queued style) | `data-hue="a"`, `data-size="line"`, text "Coastal Highway" |
| `Empty` | `{ label: '', hue: 'main', size: 'count' }`, `parameters: { rendersNothing: true }` | nothing (no next) | — | no `[data-face]` in the story root |

The long, whitespace-only and other-hue cases (D5, D7) have no story yet.

Crop positions are `board x,y w×h` in the 1440×900 renders, the same box in the dark and light render. No `Focused` story: the chip isn't focusable.

## Done when (Inspect station)

- Every story in the table exists, renders in dark and light, and its play passes (`npx vitest run src/ui`).
- `npm run shots -- WaitingChip` passes: each cropped story's screenshot is the crop's size and scores at most 0.02, and axe (colour contrast included) finds no violation on any story once the tokens contract PR has landed (L2). Until then two stories are expected to fail axe: `Board` in light (`--main` 4.42) and `Break` in dark (`--brk` 4.48); every other story passes today (`Display` and `IntroArmed` are large text).
- Only listed tokens are used; no inline colours, no literal sizes outside the Visual rules.
- svelte-check and lint pass on the folder.

## Decisions

- **D1 · A span, not a button.** All three uses (count row, display, style line) are readouts the boards draw as spans; nothing is clicked, so the chip has no role, focus or tooltip.
- **D2 · Hue set.** `hue` takes the five section hues, `a` (a queued style, Stage.md D3) and `t` (kit › Faces' neutral waiting label); the rec and lamp waiting faces belong to the Looper's and Fade's buttons, not here. The default is `t` so a missing hue never paints a section colour.
- **D3 · Empty renders nothing.** With no next section the parent hides "→" and the chip; an empty `label` renders no element, so an empty outline can never show.
- **D4 · Contrast.** The `count` and `line` sizes are normal text and need 4.5:1 on the ground; light `--main` (4.42), light `--intro` (3.87) and dark `--brk` (4.48) miss it, so those three tokens need darkening (light) or lightening (dark) in the tokens PR; the spec doesn't work around it with a second colour.
- **D5 · Only `line` truncates.** Section names are short and known ("Ending III" is the longest), so `count` and `display` never ellipsize; only a style name can run long, capped at 200px (Stage.md D34). The 200px includes the border and padding.
- **D6 · Line-height from the height.** The text is centred by `line-height = height − 2 × border` (24, 46), as the boards do, so the label's baseline matches the board in every size.
- **D7 · Whitespace is empty.** A label that is empty after `trim()` renders nothing, so a parent passing `' '` can't draw a blank outline; any other label is drawn untrimmed.
- **D8 · Shrink only in a flex row.** `line`'s `flex: 0 1 auto; min-width: 0` lets StyleLine's flex row squeeze it; anywhere else the chip is its label's width capped at `--chip-max`, and that's the width the `LongStyle` story shows.
- **D9 · New tokens and changed hues (L1, L2).** `--chip-height`, `--chip-height-display`, `--chip-max`, `--tracking-36`, the six hue-on-`--g` contrast rows and the three changed values (now Stage C6's: light `--main` #19733a, light `--intro` #6e651a, dark `--brk` #986faf, D11) land in the tokens contract PR; until then `Board` (light) and `Break` (dark) fail axe.
- **D10 · No tooltip props (L3).** The chip isn't interactive, so it takes neither `tip` nor `tipAction`.
- **D11 · Hue values are Stage C6's (review; replaces D9's three values).** D9's light `--main` #1c7e3f, light `--intro` #796f1c and dark `--brk` #9063a9 passed only on `--g` (4.53, 4.53, 4.54) and fail on `--btn` (3.98, 3.98, 3.92), where the kit also draws these hues (section captions, pad captions). Stage C6 changes the same palette entries to light `--green-700` #19733a, `--gold-700` #6e651a and dark `--plum-400` #986faf, which pass on `--g` (5.23, 5.25, 5.23) and on `--btn` (4.60, 4.62, 4.50); one value per token, so this spec, GroupHeader and Stage use C6's. C6 lands in the tokens contract PR before the screenshot check, so the axe failures named in Done when last only until then.

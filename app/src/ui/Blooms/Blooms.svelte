<!--
  Blooms: a few soft coloured glows behind a whole screen (the Stage, Library, Settings) that
  breathe with the band. Purely decorative and cheap: each bloom is a radial gradient painted once;
  only its `transform` and `opacity` animate (Web Animations, on the compositor), so a breath
  repaints nothing. No frame loop: while playing, the breaths are phase-locked to the clock
  (`beat`), one per `barsPerBreath` bars, re-checked every few seconds; when the clock jumps (a section change, a fill) they ease
  back onto it over about a breath, by their playback rate, rather than snap. The overall `level` lifts the
  whole backdrop's opacity a little, at most twice a second, through a slow CSS transition. Stopped,
  the breaths hold still and the backdrop settles to a calm, dimmer rest. Under
  `prefers-reduced-motion` nothing moves.

  It fills its positioned parent and never clips: the blooms near the edges run on past the box
  (the screen's scaler clips them), so no edge shows. The theme sets the strength (--bloom-peak,
  tokens/blooms.css: subtle in dark, much fainter in light); contrast.test.ts checks every text role
  on the worst spot. The screen above it must not paint its own ground (--backdrop-ground).

# HealthSlot

> **One baseline (PR #550).** The slot no longer has its own 35px height or centres its text: the
> slot and its button align by baseline (`align-items: baseline`) and the slot is as tall as its
> text, so the parent (AppBar) puts the text on the header baseline (`--header-baseline`, 28px)
> with every other text in the bar. Where the sections below say 35px or centred, this note wins.

## Identity (all stations)

- **Kind:** primitive
- **Built from:** —
- **Purpose:** Says "Audio" quietly while the sound is fine, and names the trouble in red (a failed plugin, no audio, dropouts, a busy CPU) with a click that opens where to fix it.
- **Boards:**
  - `Stage-Dark.dc.html:91` (calm: "Audio" in muted grey); light: `Stage-Light.dc.html:67`. Every other board's app bar draws the same calm slot.
  - `SettingsSystem-Dark.dc.html:80` (trouble: "CPU 74%" in Ending red); light: `SettingsSystem-Light.dc.html:69`.
  - The other trouble texts are listed in the boards' comment (`Stage-Dark.dc.html:90`) but not drawn.
- **Not this component's job:** no store, no API, no Tauri, no clock. It doesn't read `AppState` or keep a dropout history: the parent passes the inputs below (the dropout count over the last 30 s is the wiring's, kept from `io.synth.dropouts` against its own clock), and acts on `onopen`. It doesn't open pages itself. It is not the Launchkey status (`LaunchkeyStatus`) and not the status line (`StatusLine`).

## API (Component station)

### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `failedPart` | `0 \| 1 \| 2 \| 3 \| null` | `null` | The first keyboard part, in the order R1 R2 R3 L (0–3), whose `plugin.status` is `failed` and whose `plugin.missing` isn't true. The wiring finds it with `firstFailedPart` (below). |
| `synthOn` | `boolean` | `true` | False when `io.synth` is null (no audio). |
| `dropouts` | `number` | `0` | Audio dropouts in the last 30 s: how many times `io.synth.dropouts` rose in that window, counted by the wiring. |
| `bufferFrames` | `number \| null` | `null` | `io.synth.bufferFrames`, the buffer in use (64 … 1024). |
| `cpu` | `number \| null` | `null` | `meters.cpu.total` (1.0 = the whole buffer). Null before the first meters frame. |
| `width` | `number \| undefined` | — | A fixed width in px (stories: 100, the slot's room on the board). Default: fills its container's width (the app bar gives it what's left of its right area). |
| `tip` | `string \| null` | `'app.health'` | The tooltip key (`app/src/help/tooltips.ts`; `app.health` is new, D11), rendered as `data-tip={tip}` on the button when there is one, else on the calm text span (L3, D7, D12). Left out (or `undefined`) it is the default; `null` turns it off: no `data-tip` and no action. |
| `tipAction` | `Action<HTMLElement, string> \| undefined` | — | The app's `use:tip` action, passed in by the wiring (the library can't import it). When `tip` and `tipAction` are both set, the element carrying `data-tip` also gets `use:tipAction={tip}`; otherwise no action (L3). Stories pass `fn()`. |

### Events

| Callback | Fires when | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `onopen` | click, Enter or Space on the slot's button (only the rows with a target have one) | `(target: HealthTarget)`: `{ page: 'channel', part: 0 \| 1 \| 2 \| 3 }` for a failed plugin; `{ page: 'settings', tab: 'system' }` for every other trouble row. The parent opens it (Stage.md D32's interim targets until Channel and Settings › System land). |

### What it shows (`health.ts`)

A pure function `health(input: HealthInput): Health` in `app/src/ui/HealthSlot/health.ts` picks the one text from the props, the first row that applies (Stage.md D14: a failed plugin first, since it's silent). Its input is partial, every field optional, with the props' defaults filled in for a missing (`undefined`) field (D10):

```ts
export type HealthInput = {
  failedPart?: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | null // default null
  synthOn?: boolean // default true
  dropouts?: number // default 0
  bufferFrames?: number | null // default null
  cpu?: number | null // default null
}
export type Health = { text: string; hue: 'ending' | 'm'; target: HealthTarget | null; label: string }
```

The component calls it with its props as they are (`health({ failedPart, synthOn, dropouts, bufferFrames, cpu })`).

| # | When | Text (exact) | Hue (`data-hue`) | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `failedPart` isn't null | `R1 failed`, `R2 failed`, `R3 failed` or `L failed` | `ending` | `{ page: 'channel', part: failedPart }` |
| 2 | `synthOn` is false | `Audio off` | `m` | `{ page: 'settings', tab: 'system' }` |
| 3 | `dropouts` ≥ 3 and `bufferFrames` isn't null and < 1024 | `{dropouts} dropouts · buffer {suggestBuffer(bufferFrames)}?`, e.g. `3 dropouts · buffer 256?` (at 128 frames) | `ending` | settings › system |
| 4 | `dropouts` ≥ 1 | `1 dropout`, or `{dropouts} dropouts` (e.g. `2 dropouts`) | `ending` | settings › system |
| 5 | `cpu` isn't null and ≥ 0.70 | `CPU {Math.round(cpu × 100)}%`, e.g. `CPU 74%` (0.70 → `CPU 70%`) | `ending` | settings › system |
| 6 | otherwise (calm) | `Audio` | `m` | none |

It returns a `Health`, where `label` is `Audio health: fine` for row 6 and `Audio health: {text}` otherwise (e.g. `Audio health: CPU 74%`). Also in `health.ts`:

- `suggestBuffer(frames: number): number`: the next size up, `Math.min(frames * 2, 1024)` (64 → 128, 128 → 256, 256 → 512, 512 → 1024) (D3).
- `firstFailedPart(plugins: ({ status: string; missing?: boolean } | undefined)[]): 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | null`: the index of the first entry (R1, R2, R3, L) with `status === 'failed'` and `missing !== true`; null if none. The wiring calls it with the four keyboard parts' `plugin` (absent for a part without one).
- `HealthTarget` (`{ page: 'channel'; part: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 } | { page: 'settings'; tab: 'system' }`), `HealthInput` and `Health` are exported for the wiring.

### Visual rules

- **Tokens used:** `--m`, `--ending`, `--focus`, `--type-text`, `--tracking-text`, `--space-8`, `--line-width`, `--focus-offset`.
- **Structure:** the root is a `<span class="slot">` with `data-hue` = `hue` and no role: `position: relative`, `box-sizing: border-box`, `display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: flex-end` (the text sits at the right edge), height 34px (the app bar's 36px less its 2px header rule, `--tab-height-header`; D5), `padding-left: var(--space-8)`, `min-width: 0`, width `width` px (inline `style:width`) or `flex: 1 1 auto` in its container, `color: var(--m)` or `var(--ending)` from `hue`, no background (the app bar's ground shows through). Inside it, in order:
  1. the live region: `<span role="status" class="hidden-word">{label}</span>`, visually hidden (scoped CSS: `position: absolute; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden; clip-path: inset(50%); white-space: nowrap`, the same rule as `app.css`'s `.visually-hidden`, which the library can't rely on), so it takes no room. Its text is `label` (`Audio health: fine`, `Audio health: CPU 74%`); a change of text is what a screen reader announces (D13).
  2. with a target: one `<button type="button">`: `display: flex; align-items: center` (so the inner span is a flex item and its ellipsis works), margin 0, padding 0, border 0, background transparent, `color: inherit`, `font: inherit`, `max-width: 100%`, `min-width: 0`, cursor `pointer`, holding the text in a `<span>` with `overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap`.
  3. without one (calm): the text `Audio` in the same ellipsis `<span>`, with `aria-hidden="true"` (the live region already says "Audio health: fine").
- **Size:** 34px tall; width as above. The text never wraps; when it's wider than the slot less its 8px left padding, it ends in "…" (the slot's own box doesn't clip, so the focus ring shows).
- **States drawn by:** colour only (no face, no fill, no border; a text button, kit › Text buttons):
  - calm: `Audio` in `--m`, plain text, default cursor.
  - no audio: `Audio off` in `--m`, a button.
  - failed plugin, buffer hint, dropouts, CPU: the text in `--ending`, a button.
  - too long: ellipsis (the buffer hint in the 92px of text room the app bar's 100px slot has, D4).
  - keyboard focus (`:focus-visible` on the button): a `--line-width` solid outline in `--focus`, `--focus-offset` outside the button. Nothing on mouse focus.
  - No hover or pressed look (kit: Hover, press and cursor).
- **Type:** `--type-text` (DM Sans 13 regular, 16px line) with `--tracking-text`, sentence case as listed, `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` (so "CPU 74%" doesn't jitter as the number changes).
- **Contrast (AA 4.5:1, `tokens/contrast.test.ts`):** `--m` on `--g` (exists); `--ending` on `--g` is a **new row** ("health slot trouble (HealthSlot)"; 4.96:1 dark, #c45a5a on #000000; 5.20:1 light, #a84444 on #f2f1ee), which passes with today's values and lands in the orchestrator's tokens contract PR before the build (L1). Every token used exists today: no new tokens.
- **Motion:** none. The text changes when the props change; no blink, no timer.

### Accessibility

- **Role and name:** the hidden `role="status"` span (polite live region) holds `label` as its text (`Audio health: fine`, `Audio health: R3 failed`, …); a live region announces its content, not an `aria-label`, so it has none, and a change of `label` is announced (D13). The button, when there is one, is a sibling of the live region, named by its text (`R3 failed`, `Audio off`, `CPU 74%`). The calm `Audio` is `aria-hidden`.
- **Keyboard:** with a button, Tab reaches it (in the app bar after the page tabs); Enter or Space calls `onopen` (native button). Calm, nothing in the slot is focusable.
- **Tooltip id:** `app.health` (new: contract change, D11), one key for every state (Stage D45), the `tip` default: `data-tip` plus `use:tipAction` on the button, or, calm, on the visible text span (D12).

## Stories (Story station)

Title `Primitives/HealthSlot`, `layout: 'centered'`. Every story renders in dark and light (the toolbar theme). Every story passes `onopen: fn()`, `tip: 'app.health'` and `tipAction: fn()`. "The status's text" below is the `textContent` of `getByRole('status')`; "`data-hue`" is read from the root (`[data-hue]`). Every play with a button also checks the button has `data-tip="app.health"`; `Board` checks the calm text span has it. To press a key on a button the play first calls `button.focus()` (no click, so the key is the only call to `onopen`), then `userEvent.keyboard('{Enter}')` or `userEvent.keyboard(' ')` (`storybook/test`).

| Story | Args | Shows | Crop | Play (interaction check) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Board` | `{ failedPart: null, synthOn: true, dropouts: 0, bufferFrames: 256, cpu: 0.2, width: 100 }` | the Stage board fixture: calm, `Audio` in muted grey at the right edge (R3's plugin is missing, so it isn't "failed") | `Board-{dark,light}.png` (Stage 1316,24 100×35) | the status's text is `Audio health: fine`; the root has `data-hue="m"`; the visible `Audio` span has `aria-hidden="true"` and `data-tip="app.health"`; `queryByRole('button')` is null |
| `Cpu` | `{ synthOn: true, dropouts: 0, bufferFrames: 256, cpu: 0.74, width: 100 }` | `CPU 74%` in Ending red | `Cpu-{dark,light}.png` (SettingsSystem 1316,24 100×35) | the status's text is `Audio health: CPU 74%`, `data-hue="ending"`; click the button `CPU 74%` → `onopen` called with `{ page: 'settings', tab: 'system' }` |
| `Failed` | `{ failedPart: 2, synthOn: true, bufferFrames: 256, cpu: 0.2, width: 100 }` | `R3 failed` in red | — (not drawn on a board) | the status's text is `Audio health: R3 failed`, `data-hue="ending"`; click the button `R3 failed` → `onopen` called with `{ page: 'channel', part: 2 }` |
| `FailedBeatsOff` | `{ failedPart: 3, synthOn: false, width: 100 }` | `L failed`: a failed plugin outranks no audio | — | the button is named `L failed` |
| `AudioOff` | `{ synthOn: false, width: 100 }` | `Audio off` in muted grey, clickable | — | the status's text is `Audio health: Audio off`, `data-hue="m"`; `.focus()` the button `Audio off`, `userEvent.keyboard('{Enter}')` → `onopen` called once with `{ page: 'settings', tab: 'system' }` |
| `Dropouts` | `{ dropouts: 2, bufferFrames: 256, cpu: 0.2, width: 100 }` | `2 dropouts` in red | — | the button is named `2 dropouts`; `.focus()` it (no click), `userEvent.keyboard(' ')` → `onopen` called once, with `{ page: 'settings', tab: 'system' }` |
| `OneDropout` | `{ dropouts: 1, bufferFrames: 256, width: 100 }` | `1 dropout` (singular) | — | the button is named `1 dropout` |
| `BufferHint` | `{ dropouts: 3, bufferFrames: 128, cpu: 0.74 }` | the whole `3 dropouts · buffer 256?` in red, no width set (outranks CPU) | — | the status's text is `Audio health: 3 dropouts · buffer 256?`; the button is named `3 dropouts · buffer 256?` |
| `BufferHintInBar` | `{ dropouts: 3, bufferFrames: 128, width: 100 }` | the same text cut to the app bar's room, ending in "…" (D4) | — (not drawn; text measurement) | the status's text is still the whole `Audio health: 3 dropouts · buffer 256?`, and so is the button's name (the cut is CSS only) |
| `LargestBuffer` | `{ dropouts: 3, bufferFrames: 1024, width: 100 }` | `3 dropouts`: no larger buffer to suggest | — | the button is named `3 dropouts` |
| `Focused` | `{ cpu: 0.74, bufferFrames: 256, width: 100 }`, `parameters: { pseudo: { focusVisible: true } }` | the focus ring around `CPU 74%` | — (the boards draw no focus) | — |

Crop positions are `board x,y w×h` in the 1440×900 renders, the same box in the dark and light render. The box is the slot's room on the board: from 4px after the Launchkey label's last pixel (x 1311) to the app bar's right edge (x 1416), and from the app bar's top to just above its 1px bottom line (y 24 to 59), so the crops hold only the slot's text and the ground.

## Checks

- **Vitest, pure (`app/src/ui/HealthSlot/health.test.ts`):** each row of the table, and its order: `health({ failedPart: 2, synthOn: false, dropouts: 5, bufferFrames: 128, cpu: 0.9 })` is `R3 failed` (row 1 wins); `{ synthOn: false, dropouts: 5 }` → `Audio off`; `{ dropouts: 3, bufferFrames: 128, cpu: 0.9 }` → `3 dropouts · buffer 256?`; `{ dropouts: 4, bufferFrames: 512 }` → `4 dropouts · buffer 1024?`; `{ dropouts: 3, bufferFrames: 1024 }` → `3 dropouts`; `{ dropouts: 3, bufferFrames: null }` → `3 dropouts`; `{ dropouts: 1 }` → `1 dropout`; `{ cpu: 0.695 }` → `Audio` (the threshold is on the raw value); `{ cpu: 0.70 }` → `CPU 70%`; `{ cpu: 0.744 }` → `CPU 74%`; `{ cpu: null }` → `Audio` with label `Audio health: fine` and target null; `health({})` (every field defaulted) → `{ text: 'Audio', hue: 'm', target: null, label: 'Audio health: fine' }`. `suggestBuffer` for 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 → 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1024. `firstFailedPart([undefined, {status:'playing'}, {status:'failed', missing:true}, {status:'failed'}])` → 3; with no failed entry → null.
- **Vitest, the stories' `play` (`npx vitest run src/ui`):** the plays above: the status's text, `data-hue`, `data-tip`, the button's presence and name, `onopen`'s payload on click, Enter and Space.
- **Screenshots (`npm run shots -- HealthSlot`):** `Board` and `Cpu` against their crops (100×35, score at most 0.02). They cover what jsdom can't: the colours by hue, the right alignment, the vertical centring in 35px. `BufferHintInBar` (ellipsis) and `Focused` (ring) are judged by Inspect, without a crop. axe passes on every story.
- **Contrast:** add the row `['--ending', '--g', 'health slot trouble (HealthSlot)']` to `tokens/contrast.test.ts` (a plant file: the orchestrator's tokens contract PR lands it, D14).

## Done when (Inspect station)

- Every story in the table exists, renders in dark and light, and its play passes (`npx vitest run src/ui`); `health.test.ts` passes.
- Each cropped story's screenshot matches its crop (`npm run shots -- HealthSlot`: score at most 0.02, or the Inspect agent judges any difference to be render noise); axe finds no violation.
- Only listed tokens are used; no inline colours, no literal sizes outside the Visual rules (the 35px height and the hidden live region's `1px` box are the only ones).
- svelte-check and lint pass on the folder.

## Decisions

- **D1 · Inputs, not state.** The slot takes the few values it needs as props and a pure `health()` picks the text; the 30 s dropout window is counted by the wiring (it owns the clock), so the component has no timer (axiom 10).
- **D2 · No `DropoutWatch.show`.** The buffer hint is rule 3 (3 dropouts in 30 s, buffer below 1024, the same numbers as `app/src/lib/dropouts.svelte.ts`) computed from the window count, not the watch's latched `show`: the slot has no dismiss, so a latched hint would never go away; it now ends when the window empties.
- **D3 · The hint suggests the next size.** "buffer 256?" is a question about a size to try, so it names the next size up (double, at most 1024), not the size in use; the boards' "3 dropouts · buffer 256?" is the 128-frame case. kit.md says `io.synth.bufferFrames`; this changes it.
- **D4 · Long texts ellipsize.** The slot's room on the board is 100px (x 1316 to 1416); less its 8px left padding that leaves 92px of text, so "3 dropouts · buffer 256?" is cut with "…" in the app bar (kit: "ellipsis when long"; where it cuts is the browser's text measurement, judged by Inspect); the full text is in the live region and the button's name. Whether to shorten it is an owner question.
- **D5 · 35px tall.** The slot is the app bar's height less its 1px bottom line, with the text centred, which is where the board's text sits (the board centres a 36px right area in the bar's 35px content box).
- **D6 · Buttons named by their text.** The live region says "Audio health: …"; the button beside it is named by its visible text only, so a screen reader doesn't hear "Audio health" twice.
- **D7 · Tooltip by key plus action (L3).** The element that carries the tooltip is the button or (calm) the text span, and it comes and goes, so the parent can't place `use:tip` itself; the component takes `tip` (the key, default `app.health`, as `data-tip`) and `tipAction` (the app's action) and applies both to whichever exists. No attachment prop. Stories pass `tip: 'app.health'` and `tipAction: fn()`.
- **D8 · "Audio off" is grey but clickable.** No synth isn't an alarm the player caused (it can be a choice in Settings), so it stays `--m` as the kit says, yet it opens Settings › System like the red rows.
- **D9 · CPU rounds, the threshold doesn't.** The text rounds to a whole percent; the 0.70 test is on the raw value, so 0.695 stays calm rather than showing "CPU 70%" in red.
- **D10 · `health()` takes a partial input.** Every `HealthInput` field is optional and defaults to the prop's default (`failedPart` null, `synthOn` true, `dropouts` 0, `bufferFrames` null, `cpu` null), so the tests and the wiring pass only what they have.
- **D15 · `tip: null` turns the tooltip off.** A Svelte prop passed as `undefined` takes its default, so `null` (not `undefined`) is the off value; the same holds for StatusLine.
- **D11 · Contract change: the `app.health` tooltip key (L3).** It isn't in `app/src/help/tooltips.ts` today and lands in the tooltips contract PR (Stage C5) before the build; it blocks the build. Proposed title: `Audio health`. Proposed body: `Says Audio while the sound is fine; in red it names the trouble (a failed plugin, dropouts, a busy CPU), and a click opens where to fix it.`
- **D12 · Calm tooltip on the text span.** With no button, `data-tip` and the action go on the visible `Audio` span (not the whole slot), so the tooltip's hover area is the text in both states. (The app's `use:tip` listens for `focus`, which doesn't bubble, so with a button it must be on the button.)
- **D13 · The live region holds the words.** A live region announces its content, not its `aria-label`, so the `role="status"` is a visually hidden span whose text is `label`, beside the button; the root has no role. This replaces kit.md's `aria-label` on the status span.
- **D14 · New contrast row (L1).** `--ending` on `--g` passes with today's values (4.96:1 dark, 5.20:1 light) and is added to `contrast.test.ts` in the orchestrator's tokens contract PR; no token changes.
- **D16 · Stage C6 moves dark `--ending` (review).** C6 lightens dark `--rose-400` to #c66060 (for `--ending` on `--btn`); the slot's pair on `--g` then reads 5.24:1 dark and still passes, so nothing here changes. C6's own rows cover `--ending` on `--g`, so D14's row is the same row, not a second one.
- **D17 · The hint names the next size, against Stage D54 (review).** Stage D54 writes the row as "3 dropouts · buffer {bufferFrames}?" (the size in use); this spec keeps D3 (`suggestBuffer`, the size to try), since a question about the buffer only helps if it names a different size, and the board's "buffer 256?" fits the 128-frame case. Stage D54's other rules (the 30 s window from `DropoutWatch.recent`, no hint at 1024 or an unknown size, no dismiss) are what rows 3 and 4 do.

Follow-ups: Stage.md D54's text should read `buffer {suggestBuffer(bufferFrames)}?` (D17).

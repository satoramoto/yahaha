# yahaha

A software arranger keyboard. It loads Yamaha Genos/PSR/Tyros style files (`.sty .prs .sst ...`) and follows the chords you play on a MIDI keyboard. The band plays through a built-in SoundFont synth, and also out of a virtual MIDI port called **yahaha** so you can use your own sounds in Ableton.

## Setup

yahaha doesn't ship any styles or sounds. You add two things yourself (both folders are git-ignored):
- **Styles:** put `.sty/.prs/.sst` files in `corpus/`. Free ones are available from Yamaha, PSR Tutorial, and Sand, Software and Sound. Encrypted Expansion Packs (`.cpi`/`.ppi`) are not supported.
- **SoundFont (optional):** put a General MIDI `.sf2` in `soundfonts/`, for example [GeneralUser GS](https://github.com/mrbumpy409/GeneralUser-GS).

macOS only; it uses CoreMIDI and CoreAudio directly. The app also runs on an iPad (see [iPad](#ipad)).

## Run

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/yahaha play corpus/          # a style file or a folder of them (searched recursively)
```

On launch:
- It connects to your Launchkey's keys.
- It puts the Launchkey into DAW mode so the pads become arranger buttons, and restores standalone mode on exit.
- It waits for your first chord (**Sync Start**).

Play a chord left of **F#2** (Yamaha numbering, C3 = middle C) and the band starts.

Every `.sf2` file in `soundfonts/` is a source of sounds. The GM map decides what every program plays: your rules first, then the best-matching preset in those fonts, the most complete General MIDI one first (docs/sound-browser.md). Put at least one General MIDI font there, for example GeneralUser GS (downloaded separately; SoundFonts are not in git). It plays on your default audio output with a 64-frame buffer (about 1.3 ms at 48 kHz).
- **Keyboard parts:** like the Genos, you play four parts: **Right 1**, **Right 2** and **Right 3** right of the split, and **Left** left of it. Each part has its own voice, volume, octave shift and on/off. The Right parts that are on sound together, which is how you layer (Piano + Strings = Right 1 + Right 2 on). At start only Right 1 (Grand Piano) is on; Right 2 is Strings, Right 3 Brass, Left Strings. Turn parts on/off with the buttons under faders 1–4 (fader Panel page), the bottom-left pads on pad page 3, or `5` `6` `7` `8` (`l` also toggles Left). Pick the part whose voice you want to change with `F1`–`F4`, the EDIT pads on pad page 3, or Shift + the button under its fader, then step its voice with `9`/`0` or the VOICE −/+ pads.
- **Where your parts go:** each part has its own channel, on the `yahaha` port and in the built-in synth alike: Right 1 = ch 1, Left = ch 2 (the channels your right and left hand always had), Right 2 = ch 3, Right 3 = ch 4. A part that is off sends nothing. With Left off, the Right parts play over the whole keyboard, as on the Genos, except that in Lower chord detection (outside the Full Keyboard fingerings) the keys left of the split only drive the chords. Each part's octave shift is applied to the notes it sends. The sustain pedal and the wheels go to the parts that are on (which parts each reaches is a setting: see Pedals and wheels below); other controllers and pressure go to all four parts (polyphonic aftertouch to the notes its key sounds); the keyboard's own volume (CC 7), bank select and program changes are ignored, because each part's voice and volume are its own.
- **Mixer:** the faders have two pages, like the Genos Mixer's Panel and Style tabs. The button under the master fader (or `F9`) switches between them; it lights blue on Panel and green on Style, and the screen outlines the active page in yellow. **Shift + that button** steps the fader layer, VOL → PAN → REV → CHO → DLY: in a send layer the faders move each part's pan or reverb/chorus/delay send instead of its volume (Panel faders 1–4 and Style faders 1–8; the Style parts have no pan), picking each value up before they move it.
  - **Panel:** faders 1–4 are the volumes of Right 1, Right 2, Right 3 and Left; their buttons turn the parts on/off (lit while on). Fader 5 is the **Style volume**, the whole band against your hands (the Genos Balance page's Style slider): at 100 the Style parts play at their own levels, and it scales every Style part's CC7 as it goes out, as a Fade In/Out does, without moving their faders. The button under fader 5 is the HARMONY/ARPEGGIO switch (purple, bright while on). The button under fader 6 reloads the edited part's plugin (red while it has stopped or failed to load), and the button under fader 8 is the Chord Looper (see Controls). Fader 6 is the **Multi Pad volume**, the same kind of scale on the four pads' CC7 (the Genos Balance page's M.Pad slider). Faders 7–8 and button 7 do nothing on this page.
  - **Style:** faders 1–8 are the band's eight part volumes; their buttons mute and unmute the parts (lit while they play).
  - Every level is its part's CC 7, sent unchanged to the `yahaha` port and the built-in synth; there is no other per-part gain. Under Manual Bass, Left plays the Style's Bass voice at Left's own level (Panel fader 4), at the pitch you play (Left's octave shift is for its own voice), and Left can't be switched off until Manual Bass is. The master fader is always the synth's output level (100 = unity); a safety soft clipper above -1 dBFS keeps the output from hard clipping.
  - Loading a style sets the Style faders to the style's own levels (100 where it sets none). A volume change inside a style's pattern moves its part's fader too, until you move that fader yourself. Every section change puts back what the last section's patterns changed in the style's part setup (SInt: voices, pan, effect sends, bend ranges), routed as the new section routes its source channels (a section that sends another source to a part brings that source's voice), so parts you have not touched go back to the style's levels before the new section's own changes; the levels you set are kept. Only what differs is sent: a section change that changes nothing sends nothing, never a program change for the voice a part already has, and the XG part parameters and drum setup only after a program change that resets them. A Fill or Break that comes in mid-bar also takes the voice and controller values its skipped first beats leave. Start/Stop does the same, and also sends the style's XG effects, with insertion and variation effects moved to the parts' destination channels. The SInt's GM/XG System On resets are never sent, and its SysEx goes to the `yahaha` port only. Changing style resets all of them.
  - The Launchkey faders, master included, use soft takeover: whenever a level moves without the fader (a style load, a pattern's volume change, a restart resetting an untouched part, an OTS recall, or switching the fader page), the hardware fader does nothing until it comes within 2 of that level or crosses it (`↕` on screen until then).
- **One Touch Settings:** each style carries four suggested panel setups. Each one sets Right 1–3 and Left: voice, on/off, volume, octave shift, pan and reverb/chorus sends; the Panel faders then pick the new volumes up. Recall one with `shift+1`–`4` or the OTS pads on pad page 3. **OTS Link** (pad page 3, Shift + Pad Bank ▼, or `F10`) makes Main A–D recall settings 1–4 automatically, and picks the right one when you change style.
- **Keyboard Harmony / Arpeggio:** one HARMONY/ARPEGGIO switch (`J`, the button under fader 5 on the Panel fader page, or the app's Harmony panel) and one type, as on the Genos. The type is a Keyboard Harmony type (Duet, Trio, Block, 4-Way, 1+5, Octave, Strum, Multi Assign, Echo, Tremolo, Trill; our own voicings, see [docs/harmony.md](docs/harmony.md)) or one of yahaha's own arpeggio patterns ([docs/arpeggio.md](docs/arpeggio.md)); `L` steps through them. Only the keys right of the split are processed. The harmony follows the chord you play for the style; only the top note of the right hand is harmonised. The arpeggio follows the style clock while the band plays (Quantize lines it up with the bar) and its own clock while it is stopped; `*` is the Arpeggio Hold setting (a pedal can hold it too, apart from the setting). Volume, Assign, Chord Note Only, Touch Limit, Speed, Quantize, Velocity and Keep Key On are in the app.
- **Stop Accompaniment** (`h`): with Sync Start off and the band stopped, a held chord sounds on the style's bass and pad voices.
- `k` mutes the synth, for example when you're using Ableton sounds instead.
- The synth plays on outputs 11/12 when the audio device is a TASCAM Model 16, and on 1/2 otherwise. `a` steps through the output pairs while playing, and `--audio-out 11` sets the pair at launch.

Options:
- `--soundfonts DIR` uses another SoundFont folder.
- `--audio-out N` sends the synth to outputs N/N+1.
- `--buffer 64|128|256|512|1024` sets the synth's audio buffer in frames (default 64, or the size last chosen in Settings › Audio). Heavy plugins, or a busy machine, may need 128 or 256; 512 and 1024 trade 10–21 ms of latency for the most headroom.
- `--no-synth` turns the synth off, leaving MIDI out only.
- `--palette-leds` uses the Launchkey's built-in palette colours instead of RGB SysEx.
- `--split C3` moves the split point. You can also use `[` and `]` while playing.
- `--input "Name"` picks MIDI sources by name.
- `--all-inputs` merges every connected keyboard.
- `--no-pads` leaves the Launchkey pads alone.
- Keyboards and the Launchkey can be plugged in and out while yahaha runs: a new keyboard is heard (by the `--input`/`--all-inputs` rules), and a Launchkey plugged back in goes back to DAW mode with its pads and LEDs. `yahaha fake-device` makes a Launchkey-like device from another process for trying it.
- `--top` (or `YAHAHA_TOP=1`) shows a live performance view instead of the front panel. Its header has the process's memory; the audio callback's average, p99 and worst time against the buffer's deadline and its load; the dropout counts; the voices; the callback's stages; the synth rings' depth; the engine's wake timing and queues; and MIDI input latency. Below that is one row per part (the keyboard parts, the Style parts, the Multi Pads) with its source (SoundFont or plugin), voices, peak level and render time, and one row per effect block. It refreshes every second, and `q` quits. The desktop app launched from a terminal takes the same flag or variable and draws the view in that terminal. Collection costs nothing measurable while the view is off. `yahaha bench-audio <style> <font.sf2> --top` prints one frame of the view for an offline run.
- `--chord-settle MS` sets the chord-settle window (0–30 ms, default 10): while the style plays, it follows a chord once the chord has held still this long, so a rolled chord is one change, not two. Also in the app's Settings › Chord.

## iPad

The desktop app (`app/`) also builds for iPad as a Tauri iOS app. You build it on a Mac and install it over USB or Wi-Fi. The Launchkey plugs into the iPad's USB-C port, directly or through a hub.

**Prerequisites (once):**
- Xcode with the iOS platform installed (Xcode › Settings › Components), and `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app`.
- Your Apple ID signed in under Xcode › Settings › Accounts. A free account works; its builds expire after 7 days, so you rebuild and reinstall then. The team is set in `app/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (`bundle.iOS.developmentTeam`); change it to your own team ID.
- The iPad trusted by this Mac (plug it in and tap **Trust**), and **Developer Mode** on (Settings › Privacy & Security › Developer Mode, then restart the iPad). The Developer Mode switch only appears after the iPad has been connected to Xcode once: open Xcode › Window › Devices and Simulators with it plugged in.
- `rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios`
- CocoaPods: `brew install cocoapods`
- The Tauri CLI: `cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2" --locked`
- `npm ci` in `app/`

**Build, install and launch:**

```bash
cd app
cargo tauri ios build --target aarch64
xcrun devicectl list devices                  # the Identifier column is the device's UDID
xcrun devicectl device install app --device <UDID> src-tauri/gen/apple/build/yahaha-app_iOS.xcarchive/Products/Applications/yahaha.app
xcrun devicectl device process launch --terminate-existing --device <UDID> dev.yahaha.app
```

`--device` also takes the iPad's name as `devicectl list devices` shows it. `ios build` makes a release build, signed with your development certificate. After the first install, iPadOS may ask you to trust the developer in Settings › General › VPN & Device Management.

`cargo tauri ios run --release` doesn't work yet: tauri-cli (2.9.6 and later) builds and signs the app, then fails at the export step with `Couldn't load -exportOptionsPlist The file ".tmpXXXXXX" couldn't be opened` (tauri-apps/tauri#14593). Install with `devicectl` as above instead.

**Styles and SoundFonts:** the app reads them from its Documents folder, `Documents/yahaha/styles` and `Documents/yahaha/soundfonts`, which it creates on first launch. In the Files app they are **On My iPad › yahaha › yahaha › styles** and **soundfonts**: copy `.sty/.prs/.sst` files and `.sf2` files there, then restart the app. With no styles it runs a demo band with no sound. From the Mac:

```bash
xcrun devicectl device copy to --device <UDID> --domain-type appDataContainer --domain-identifier dev.yahaha.app \
  --source corpus/MyStyles --destination Documents/yahaha/styles/MyStyles
xcrun devicectl device copy to --device <UDID> --domain-type appDataContainer --domain-identifier dev.yahaha.app \
  --source soundfonts/GeneralUser-GS.sf2 --destination Documents/yahaha/soundfonts/GeneralUser-GS.sf2
```

**Limits on iPad:**
- No plugins: plugin hosting isn't built for iOS, so every part plays through the built-in SoundFont synth.
- Memory: every `.sf2` in `soundfonts/` is loaded whole into RAM, and iPadOS closes an app that uses much more than about half of the iPad's memory. A GM font like GeneralUser GS (about 30 MB) is fine; a font of several hundred MB, or several large fonts, can get the app closed on launch on an iPad with 4–8 GB. Keep only the fonts you use in the folder.

## Ableton setup (once)

1. **Preferences → Link, Tempo & MIDI.**
   - Set the Launchkey *Control Surface* to **None** while jamming, because yahaha owns the pads.
   - Turn **Track** input **on** for `yahaha`.
   - Turn **Track** input **off** for the Launchkey. Your playing reaches Ableton through yahaha, so leaving it on doubles every note.
2. Create one MIDI track per channel, each with *MIDI From* `yahaha`:

   | ch | part | ch | part |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | 1 | Right 1 (your right hand) | 11 | Bass |
   | 2 | Left (your left hand, when the Left part is on) | 12 | Chord 1 |
   | 3 | Right 2 (right-hand layer) | 13 | Chord 2 |
   | 4 | Right 3 (right-hand layer) | 14 | Pad |
   | 9 | Rhythm 1 (sub drums) | 15 | Phrase 1 |
   | 10 | Rhythm 2 (main drums) | 16 | Phrase 2 |

   The screen shows which Yamaha voice each part was written for (e.g. "≈ Finger Bass"), so you know what sound to load. Drum parts use the GM drum map.

   Channels 11–16 get a pitch bend range of at least 12 semitones (RPN 0), because a chord change can bend a held note to its new pitch. A part whose patterns bend on their own gets more, up to 24, so the pattern's bend fits on top; so does a style that sets more itself. If an instrument ignores RPN, set its pitch bend range by hand: 12, or 24 to be safe.
3. Arm the tracks, or set Monitor to *In*.

## Controls

The screen shows a live map of the pads, in the same colours as the hardware:
- **dim**: the section is available
- **bright**: playing, or the feature is on
- **flashing**: queued; takes over at the next bar (fills at the next beat)
- **pulsing**: armed and waiting for you
- **dark**: this style doesn't have it

### Pad pages

The 16 pads have five pages. The **Pad Bank ▲/▼** buttons left of the pads switch pages: ▼ goes to the next page, ▲ to the previous one, and they stop at the ends, so a few presses of ▲ always take you home to page 1. The arrows light in the current page's colour where there is a page to go to. `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` switch pages from the terminal too, and the on-screen pad map always shows the current page and its name.

**Page 1 · Sections** (per-section colours, the original layout):

| pad | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| top | Intro I | Intro II | Intro III | Sync Start | Ending I | Ending II | Ending III | Auto Fill |
| bottom | Main A | Main B | Main C | Main D | Break | Tap tempo | Sync Stop | Start/Stop |

Pressing the current Main again plays its fill. With Auto Fill on, switching Main plays a fill into the new one.

**Page 2 · Chord/Setup** (all cyan):

| pad | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| top | Single Finger | Fingered | Fingered On Bass | Multi Finger | AI Fingered | Full Keyboard | AI Full Keyboard | Upper (on) / Lower (off) |
| bottom | Manual Bass | Stop ACMP | Split − | Split + | Keyboard transpose − | Keyboard transpose + | Transpose reset | Retrigger |

- The lit fingering pad is the active type. Upper overrides it with Fingered* until you go back to Lower.
- Manual Bass is dark in Lower, where it isn't available.
- The transpose pads light while the transpose is down, up, or not zero.
- Retrigger lights while it is on: each chord you play then restarts the Main and loops its first 1/8 (the length is in Settings › Style, or Shift + > / Function).

**Page 3 · OTS/Parts** (all magenta):

| pad | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| top | OTS 1 | OTS 2 | OTS 3 | OTS 4 | OTS Link | Fade In/Out | Voice − | Voice + |
| bottom | Right 1 on/off | Right 2 on/off | Right 3 on/off | Left on/off | Edit Right 1 | Edit Right 2 | Edit Right 3 | Edit Left |

- The lit OTS pad is the last one recalled. OTS pads the style doesn't have are dark.
- Fade lights while a fade is armed, running or holding the silence after a fade out.
- The on/off pads are lit while the part is on. The lit Edit pad is the part whose voice Voice −/+ (`9`/`0`) changes.
- The accompaniment parts are muted with the buttons under the faders on the Style fader page, or `z`…`,`.

**Page 4 · Quick Racks** (orange): Quick Racks 1–8 of the bank on view (top row: red is the loaded rack, blue a rack, dark empty); Bank −/+ (A–H), two dark pads, Store (then press a button to put the current rack on it), a dark pad, Rack −/+ (the previous/next rack in the bank) (bottom row) (docs/racks.md). With unsaved changes, a pad switches anyway and keeps them as a "Recovered" rack.

**Page 5 · Multi Pads** (yellow):

| pad | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| top | Multi Pad 1 | Multi Pad 2 | Multi Pad 3 | Multi Pad 4 | STOP | – | – | – |
| bottom | Select 1 | Select 2 | Select 3 | Select 4 | Stop 1 | Stop 2 | Stop 3 | Stop 4 |

- Pads 1–4 light as the Genos lamps: blue has data, red plays, flashing red waits for Synchro Start, flashing amber waits for the bar line, dark is empty.
- STOP stops every pad and cancels Synchro Start; it lights while a pad plays or waits.
- Select *n* is the Genos SELECT + pad: Synchro Start standby for that pad (it flashes while armed). Stop *n* is STOP + pad: that pad stops now.
- Like the section pads, the presses go straight to the engine.

### Knobs

The 8 encoders are the Genos LIVE CONTROL knobs, on Knob Assign pages. The **encoder page buttons ▲/▼** (right of the knobs) switch pages, as the Genos KNOB ASSIGN button does, stopping at the ends. The knobs are relative: a turn moves the value from where it is now, whoever set it last. Knob 8 is tempo on the Style, Parts and Pan pages; each effect page (Reverb, Chorus, Delay) has Right 1, Right 2, Right 3 and Left's send to that effect on knobs 1-4, the effect's own settings on 5-7 and its return on 8. Turning an effect setting pins that effect to your own (its Style switch in the mixer goes off), as the mixer's editor does. The same pages, names and values are in the app's knob strip.

| knob | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1 · Style** | Dynamics | Retrigger length | Retrigger on/off | Style Track Mute A | Style Track Mute B | – | – | Tempo |
| **2 · Parts** | Right 1 volume | Right 2 volume | Right 3 volume | Left volume | Harmony volume | Metronome volume | – | Tempo |
| **3 · Pan** | Right 1 pan | Right 2 pan | Right 3 pan | Left pan | Reverb return | Chorus return | Delay return | Tempo |
| **4 · Reverb** | Right 1 reverb | Right 2 reverb | Right 3 reverb | Left reverb | Reverb time | Reverb pre-delay | Reverb tone | Reverb return |
| **5 · Chorus** | Right 1 chorus | Right 2 chorus | Right 3 chorus | Left chorus | Chorus rate | Chorus depth | – | Chorus return |
| **6 · Delay** | Right 1 delay | Right 2 delay | Right 3 delay | Left delay | Delay time | Delay feedback | Delay tone | Delay return |

- **Dynamics** is the Style Dynamics level (64 = as written), 2 a step. It only acts while Settings › Style › Dynamics Control is on.
- **Retrigger length** turns shorter to the right (1/1 … 1/32), **Retrigger on/off** turns it on to the right and off to the left; both switch every 3 steps.
- **Style Track Mute A/B** start fully right (every Style part on). Turning left takes parts out until one is left: A keeps Rhythm 2, then brings in Rhythm 1, Bass, Chord 1, Chord 2, Pad, Phrase 1, Phrase 2; B keeps Chord 1, then Chord 2, Pad, Bass, Phrase 1, Phrase 2, Rhythm 1, Rhythm 2 (RM p.148). They set the parts' on/off switches, as the Style fader buttons do.
- **Tempo** moves 1 BPM a step; the volumes, pans and sends 2 a step (a part's volume is its CC7, as its fader; pan is its CC10, L64 … C … R63; Reverb and Chorus its CC91 and CC93, as in the Mixer drawer).
- **FX** turns the effect blocks' parameters (#236), as the Mixer's effect editors do: reverb time 0.1 s a step, pre-delay 2 ms, tone 200 Hz, feedback 2%, chorus rate 0.02 Hz and depth 0.1 ms. **Delay time** steps the note value (1/16 … 1/2) every 3 steps with tempo sync on, or the time 10 ms a step with it off.
- yahaha turns the encoders' relative output on when it puts the Launchkey in DAW mode. They also work in the Transport encoder mode (Shift + the pad under "Transport"), which is always relative.

### Buttons

| button | does |
|---|---|
| **Play** | start/stop |
| **Stop** | stop |
| **< Track** / **Track >** | previous/next style, playing or stopped (folder, then name: the browser's order) |
| **Pad Bank ▲ / ▼** (left of the pads) | previous/next pad page |
| **▲ / ▼ right of the knobs** | previous/next Knob Assign page |
| **Shift + Pad Bank ▲ / ▼** | Left part on/off / OTS Link on/off |
| **Shift + encoder page ▼** | ACMP on/off |
| **> (Scene Launch)** / **Function** (right of the pads) | tempo + / − (1 BPM; hold to repeat, faster the longer it is held; both together: the style's own tempo) |
| **Shift + Play** | Section Reset: the section starts again from its top |
| **Shift + Stop** | Fade In/Out: stopped, arm a fade in; playing, fade out and stop |
| **Shift + > / Shift + Function** | Retrigger length shorter / longer |
| buttons under faders 1–8 | Panel page: Right 1–3, Left on/off (Shift: edit that part's voice), button 5 Harmony/Arpeggio on/off, button 6 reload the edited part's plugin (red while it stopped or failed to load), button 7 Left Hold on/off (orange while on), button 8 Chord Looper ON/OFF (Shift: REC/STOP; dim green = a loop to play, dim yellow = armed, green = looping, dim red / red = recording armed / recording) · Style page: mute/unmute the style parts |
| button under the master fader | fader page Panel / Style (Shift: next fader layer VOL/PAN/REV/CHO/DLY) |

### The Launchkey display

Touch or move any control yahaha maps (a pad, a button, a fader, a fader button, a knob) and the Launchkey's display says what it did: where it is, the function's name and its new value, e.g. `Pads: Sections` / `MAIN B` / `Fill In BB`, `Knobs: Style` / `Dynamics Control` / `72`, `Faders: Panel` / `LEFT` / `96 > 80` (the level is 96 and the fader, not caught yet by soft takeover, is at 80). The Style and Multi Pad volumes on Panel faders 5 and 6 read in percent (`STYLE` / `85%`, 100% = as written). The value follows for a moment after the touch, so a tempo or section change shows once the band has it. The display then goes back to the normal screen after the Launchkey's own display timeout (Settings on the Launchkey). The faders' and knobs' own raw CC readouts are turned off while yahaha drives the Launchkey.

The last Launchkey note or CC that nothing is mapped to shows at the bottom of the screen, e.g. `unmapped CC 103 = 127`. If a button does nothing, that shows the number it really sends.

### Pedals and wheels

The keyboard's pedals and wheels work through the keyboard parts, as on a Genos
(docs/controllers.md; set them up in the app: Settings → Controllers):

- **Sustain** (the Launchkey's sustain jack, CC 64) holds the notes of the parts that are
  on: Right 1–3 and Left by default. A part switched on while the pedal is down joins it;
  one switched off is released.
- **Pitch bend** reaches all four parts, **modulation** Right 1–3 by default, each with
  its own Pitch Bend Range (0–12 semitones, default 2).
- **Pedals 1–3** listen for a CC each (default 64 Sustain, 66 Sostenuto, 67 Soft) and can
  run any assignable function instead: Start/Stop, Sync Start/Stop, Intro, Main A–D, Fill
  Up/Down/Self, Break, Ending, Auto Fill, OTS 1–4 and OTS +/−, tempo, transpose, part
  on/off, Fingered ⇄ On Bass, Kbd Harmony/Arpeggio On/Off, Arpeggio Hold, or Modulation /
  Pitch Bend from an expression pedal.
  "Learn" in the app takes the CC from the next pedal press.
- **Panic** (`\`) releases the pedal and centres the wheels on every keyboard part, and a
  keyboard unplugged with its pedal down is released too. A Hold pedal on Kbd
  Harmony/Arpeggio or Arpeggio Hold lets go of the switch it was keeping on. A held pedal carries across
  style and section changes untouched.

The screen shows `sus` beside each part the pedal is holding.

- `F1`–`F4` pick the part to edit (Right 1–3, Left) · `9 0` previous/next voice for it
- `F9` fader page Panel / Style
- `J` Harmony/Arpeggio on/off · `L` next Harmony type or arpeggio · `*` Arpeggio Hold

- `esc` twice (within 1.5 s) quit, or `ctrl+c`; one `esc` closes the style browser

### Style browser

`yahaha play <folder>` finds every style under the folder and its subfolders (`.sty .prs .sst .bcs .pcs .pst .fps`, any case). Press `enter` to browse them:

- Each row shows the style's name (from the file, or the file name if it has none), its folder, tempo and time signature, plus the sections it has. The folder is the category.
- The list fills in right after launch while a background thread reads the files; rows show `…` until they're read. A file that can't be read shows as a red error row and is skipped by `←/→`.
- The style that's loaded is marked `▶`, and the cursor starts on it.
- **Type** to filter: a case-insensitive match on the name or folder. `backspace` edits the filter.
- `↑/↓`, `PgUp/PgDn` and `Home/End` move the cursor.
- `enter` loads the style and closes the browser. It works like `←/→`: while the band plays it keeps playing and follows your next chord in the new style.
- `esc` closes the browser without changing the style (with the browser closed, `esc` twice quits, so one extra `esc` never stops the band).
- While the browser is open, typed keys only go to the filter, never to the performance shortcuts. Your MIDI keyboard, the Launchkey pads and the Launchkey buttons keep working as usual, including **< Track / Track >**.

### iReal Pro charts

`yahaha play <styles> --ireal <playlist.html | irealb://…>` imports an iReal Pro playlist (an exported `.html` file, or a link), chooses its first song and turns **chart mode** on. In chart mode the band takes its chords from the chart instead of your left hand:

- Press `space` (or play a chord with Sync Start on) to start. An Intro plays first, then the chart, then an Ending.
- Chart sections A–D play Main A–D. With Auto Fill on, a fill leads into each new section.
- Play a chord to reharmonize: it holds until the next bar line, then the chart takes over again.
- Keyboard transpose (`; '`) moves the chart too.
- `M` (shift+m) turns chart mode on/off (plain `m` is Style part 7); `( )` pick the previous/next song of the playlist.

The chart player is terminal-only for now: the desktop app leaves charts out of this release. [docs/ireal.md](docs/ireal.md) has the details.

Chords are recognized in "Fingered On Bass" style, plus some shortcuts:
- one key = major
- two keys = power chord, major/minor third, or 7th
- the lowest note becomes a slash bass
- three adjacent keys = chord cancel (drums only)

## Architecture

```
CoreMIDI receive thread ──chord (AtomicU32) + commands (SPSC ring) + semaphore──▶ engine thread (Mach real-time)
CoreMIDI receive thread ──Launchkey actions (SPSC) + semaphore──▶ session control
session control (commands, LEDs, OTS Link, style loading) ──styles/commands (SPSC)──▶ engine thread
engine thread ──snapshots, old styles (SPSC) + semaphore──▶ session control
clients (terminal UI, desktop app) ──AppCmd──▶ Session ──AppState──▶ clients
```

The engine, the runtime and the app API are the `yahaha` library. A `Session` owns MIDI, the engine thread, the synth and the Launchkey. Clients send `AppCmd`s and read `AppState` snapshots, and never touch the engine. The terminal UI is the `yahaha` binary's client, and the desktop app will be another. The contract is in [docs/app-api.md](docs/app-api.md).

- **Input thread** (CoreMIDI's own receive thread, running our callback):
  - forwards your notes straight to the output, on each keyboard part that is on (Right 1 ch 1, Left ch 2, Right 2 ch 3, Right 3 ch 4)
  - recognizes chords with a precomputed table of 4096×12 entries
  - publishes the result without locking
- **Engine thread**:
  - sleeps on a Mach semaphore until the next pattern event or an input signal, whichever comes first
  - spins the last 150 µs to hit the deadline exactly
  - never locks, allocates, or does I/O
- New styles are prepared on the session's control side, swapped in by pointer, and freed back there.
- Every note is transposed at the moment it plays, and there is no lookahead. A chord change therefore reaches the very next note, and notes already sounding are re-pitched according to the style's retrigger rule: Pitch Shift bends them with the part's pitch bend (one bend per part, so a note that needs a different shift is retriggered), Retrigger plays them again at the new pitch. A note that started less than 40 ms before the chord arrived is corrected outright, and one that ends (or is struck again) less than 40 ms after it is left to end rather than attacked again.

`yahaha bench <style>` measures the real path through CoreMIDI (M-series Mac, 2026-09):

| path | p50 | p99 |
|---|---|---|
| keyboard → passthrough out | 67 µs | 190 µs |
| chord → first band note (sync start) | 143 µs | 235 µs |
| chord published → engine applied | <15 µs | <28 µs |
| engine timing error vs. schedule | <1 µs | <1 µs |

## Other commands

- `yahaha dump <style>`: sections, channels, and CASM rules.
- `yahaha sim <style> "C Am7 F G7"`: offline render, one chord per bar, printed per part.
- `yahaha render <style> "C Am7 F G7" <font.sf2> <out.wav>`: the same played through the built-in SoundFont synth into a 48 kHz WAV, for listening tests. Keep the WAVs off the repo (they are the style's patterns). `YAHAHA_VEL_FILTER=off` (here, with `play`, or for the app) turns off velocity → tone: the SF2 default velocity → filter cutoff modulator and the SoundFont's own, which yahaha bakes into the SoundFont as it loads (#203, `crates/yahaha-synth/src/synth/font.rs`).
- `yahaha capture-kit <out-dir> [--clock-ppm N] [style]...`: writes the Genos-owner reference capture kit, with a chord-script MIDI file per style and instructions (`src/capture-kit/`). `--clock-ppm` runs the files that much faster, for an instrument whose clock drifts past a style's tolerance.
- `yahaha capture-import <recording.mid> <style>`: compares a hardware recording of that kit with what yahaha plays, bar by bar and part by part. `--golden tests/reference` turns a verified recording into a reference digest (`tests/reference/README.md`).
- `yahaha oracle corpus/ [--pairs | --scores | --diff tests/oracle/scores.txt]`: scores our chord conversion against the authors' own major/minor source channels (docs/oracle.md). Counts only.
- `yahaha bench <style> [spin_us]`: latency benchmark using virtual ports.
- `yahaha drive`: fake keyboard for testing against a running `yahaha play --input TestKbd`.
- `yahaha state-json <style or folder> ["C Am F"] [--library]`: an offline session's `AppState` (or its library) as JSON, after playing the chords one bar each. This is mock data for the app (docs/app-api.md).

Tests: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) lists the commands that must pass, and when to run each one. Run the ones that cover your change before opening a pull request; CI runs them all in `develop`'s merge queue. Locally, the engine's check is the core suite, `cargo test --workspace --exclude yahaha-app --profile test-quick --features plugins --lib` (add a test name to filter): the tests of the `yahaha` library and its layer crates under `crates/` without the slow ones, which are behind the `slow-tests` feature and run in CI (`--features slow-tests`). The `test-quick` profile builds everything unoptimised with debug assertions except rustysynth, which is optimised, so it compiles quickly and the audio tests still run fast; `cargo test --release` (release semantics) still works and runs the same tests. The suite covers the spec's transposition examples, chord recognition, and a full performance of every style in `corpus/`, checking for stuck notes. The oracle scores in `tests/oracle/scores.txt` are pinned too: a change to note conversion fails `oracle::tests::corpus_scores` (`cargo test --profile test-quick --features slow-tests corpus_scores`, with the corpus) with the score delta until you regenerate them with `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1`.

`cargo tauri dev` watches the whole workspace; the `.taurignore` files (repo root and `app/src-tauri`) keep its watcher off agent worktrees, `node_modules`, Vite caches and build output.

## Developing on Linux

yahaha runs on macOS only, but it builds and tests on Linux so that development (mostly agents) can happen there. On Linux there is no MIDI (a no-op backend) and no plugin hosting, so leave out `--features plugins`.

- **Docker:** `docker build -t yahaha-linux .` then `docker run --rm yahaha-linux` runs what CI's merge queue runs on Linux ([AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)), slow tests included, on the copied source. Append a command to run just that one. To test the live checkout instead, run `docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work -v /work/app/node_modules yahaha-linux`. The second volume keeps the image's Linux `node_modules`, and Linux build output goes to `target/linux`, apart from the macOS `target/`.
- **Native:** install Rust, Node 22, and the packages listed in the `Dockerfile` (`pkg-config`, `libasound2-dev`, `build-essential`, and the Tauri WebKitGTK packages). Then run `npm ci` in `app/` and the Linux commands in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs those commands on Linux (`npm run verify` included), and the plugin tests and the app shell's tests on macOS, as parallel jobs. It runs in `develop`'s merge queue (on each pull request merged onto `develop`'s tip) and on pushes to `develop`; on the pull request itself its checks pass without building.
- **Signing:** the macOS setup signs commits with 1Password (`op-ssh-sign`), which agents on Linux can't use. Commits made there are unsigned or signed with that machine's own key.

## Agent feedback loop

Each worktree can run [bacon](https://dystroy.org/bacon) headless (`bacon --headless`). It re-runs a job on every source change and, after every run, writes `.bacon-result.json` (git-ignored): the exit code, error/warning/failed-test counts and each item's location and message. The file's mtime is the run's finish time. The commands to start it and read the result are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) under "Feedback loop".

The jobs (`bacon.toml`): `check` (default), `check-portable` (no plugins, for Linux), `core` and `core-portable` (the core suite), `clippy`, `test`. The `test-quick` profile (Cargo.toml) builds everything unoptimised except rustysynth, for an agent's targeted tests, the core suite and CI. Measured on the development Mac, warm, after a one-line edit in `crates/yahaha-fx/src/fx.rs`: `check` result in about 3 s; one lib test in 5.5 s under `test-quick`.

## Known gaps

- The NTT transposition tables are reconstructed from documentation and have not yet been checked against a real Genos (see PLAN.md §4).
- Not done yet: ritardando on a second Ending press, Ableton Link, audio styles, the OTS filter, portamento, bend range and XG part settings (voice, volume, octave, pan and sends are recalled), and the Ctb2 bytes that are still undocumented.

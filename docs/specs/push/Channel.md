# Channel

One part's channel: its sound, level, tone, sends, EQ, compressor, inserts and play settings,
with the band still under your hands. The screen a player goes to when a part needs shaping.

- **Issue:** #501 · **Flow:** Shape the mix · **Boards:** `docs/design/push/Channel-Dark.dc.html`,
  `Channel-Light.dc.html`; pictures `docs/design/push/png/Channel-Dark.png`, `Channel-Light.png`
  (1440 × 900). The spec stands without them: every value a builder needs is below, in
  [kit.md](kit.md) or in [Stage.md](Stage.md); the board lines in the Components table are for
  cutting crops.
- **Copied from:** Stage (#500). This spec says what differs and refers to Stage.md and kit.md for
  the rest: the app bar, section row, faces, tokens, type, interaction conventions, the strips,
  knobs, pads, transport and key strip are the kit's; this file adds the **tall page** layout, the
  page's own regions (compact now-playing block, parts list, part header, the four groups) and, in
  "Kit additions", the parts the kit says this spec owns: the app bar's page variant, the half
  band, the compact block and the key row's status line. Until kit.md takes them in, they are
  normative here and every tall page reads them from this file.
- **Built from:** kit › App bar (page variant, below), Section row, Faces, Tokens, Interaction
  conventions; the half band, key row and status line below; Stage.md › Display › Chord (the
  chord runs), Sounds row (the sound cell's number, name and marks), D6 (knob names), D7 (meters),
  D18 (Sound latch), D23 (fader drag), D32 (interim links).
- **Variants of this screen** (they spec only what differs): Channel-StylePart (#518): the page
  with a Style part open.
- **Glance order** (what must read first, brightest to quietest): the open part's block in the
  header and the parts list (solid in its hue), the compact chord (48px, `--a`), the level and
  send values (18px light), the group headers (14px `--m`). The only glows on the page are the
  compact chord (`--ba`), the run dot and the app bar's Launchkey dot (`--bg`), the count row's
  current beat block, and the band's (fader fills, pads, Start / Stop); the light theme has none.
- **Before building:** CH-C1 (tooltips) and Stage's C5 (its keys `nav.channel`, `app.health`,
  `metronome.settings`, `display.band_sends` are not in `tooltips.ts` yet, and `TipKey` won't
  type-check without them) must land first. The rest of the contract changes don't block (see
  Contract changes needed). The Channel lane builds after the Stage lane (CH-D22): every
  component the Components table marks "Stage" and `Stage.fixtures.ts` are the Stage lane's
  files, reused as built.

## Layout

At 1440 × 900. The `Channel` component always lays out at 1440 × 900; the app shell scales it to
the window (Stage.md D1). Padding 24 all round; a column.

| Region | Box | What's in it | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| App bar | `24,24 1392×36` | wordmark, rack readout, One Touch 1–4, page tabs (Channel chosen), Launchkey status, health slot | Kit additions › App bar, page variant |
| Section row | `24,68 1392×32` | Accomp, count row, Metronome ▾, Unison, Panic, ? | kit › Section row |
| Page | `24,112 1392×468` | compact block, parts list, part header, the four groups | below |
| Half band | `24,600 1392×176` | faders, Track, knobs, pads, transport, at half height | Kit additions › Half band |
| Key row | `24,796 1392×80` | the status line with the key readouts (20), then the key strip (56) | Kit additions › Key row |

Vertical rhythm: app bar, 8, section row, 12, page, 20, half band, 20, key row (status 20, 4,
strip 56). The totals: 24 + 36 + 8 + 32 + 12 + 468 + 20 + 176 + 20 + 80 + 24 = 900.

The page is a tall page: it replaces the Stage's display **and** takes the full band's place,
leaving the half band so the nine faders and their buttons stay in view (DECISIONS H1). Every
display tab other than Stage uses this frame (CH-D1).

## Page

`24,112 1392×468`, no surface, no border, `overflow: hidden`. Inside, an inset of 24 left and
right and 16 top and bottom gives the content box `48,128 1344×436`, a row with gap 24:

| Part | Box | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| Left column | `48,128 320×436` | Compact block (84), then (16 below) the parts list |
| Divider | `392,128 1×436`, `--line`, `aria-hidden` | — |
| Content column | `417,128 975×436` | Part header (36), then (12 below) the groups grid (380) |

### Compact block

`48,128 320×84`, a `role="group"` whose `aria-label` is the "Now playing: …" template at the end
of this section, a column, `overflow: hidden`; not
a control, no tooltip of its own except the chord's (`display.chord`) and tempo's
(`display.tempo`). Everything in it is the Stage display's, at the compact size; the count row
above carries beat, bar and next. Its rows take 16 + 12 + 48 = 76 of the 84: the last 8px are
empty, so the parts list below lands on the board's y.

- **Row 1**, 16 tall, items centred, gap 8, no wrap:
  - the style name as an accent block: padding 0 6, 13 / 500, line-height 16, `--g` on `--a`,
    `min-width: 0`, ellipsis (`style.name`; an empty name: the last `/`-segment of `style.path`
    without its extension). It is a text button: click opens the Browser (Stage D3; tooltip
    `browser.open`; `aria-label` "{name}: open the Browser").
  - `margin-left: auto`: the tempo, 18 / 300, line-height 16, `--t`, `Math.round(transport.tempo)`
    then "BPM" 12 / 400 `--m` with 3px left margin.
  - the run dot, 6px round, `data-run="running|sync|stopped"`: `transport.running` → `--ok`
    with `--bg`, `role="img"` `aria-label="Running"`; stopped with `transport.syncStart` → a
    hollow 1px `--ok` ring, "Sync start"; stopped → `visibility: hidden` (space kept), no label.
- **Row 2**, 12 below, 48 tall, items on the baseline, gap 14, no wrap:
  - the chord: 48 / 300, line-height 48, letter-spacing −2, `--a`, `text-shadow: var(--ba)`, in
    the Stage's two runs (`splitChord`, the Stage lane's pure function, Stage D30 and check 6;
    Stage.md gives it no path, so it is imported from wherever the Stage lane put it, expected
    `app/src/ui/ChordReadout/chord.ts`, and this spec names no second copy): base 300,
    extension 200 with letter-spacing 0.
    No chord: "—" in `--d`, no shadow. The font never shrinks; `min-width: 0`, `overflow:
    hidden` (clipped, no ellipsis) when even the chord alone doesn't fit beside the section
    (CH-D2).
  - the tones: 14 / 300, letter-spacing 3, `--t2`: the chord's tones as note names, root first,
    spaced ("A C E G"), the same tones and spelling as the Stage's tone columns (Stage › Chord, D20,
    D31); `min-width: 0`, `overflow: hidden`, ellipsis, `flex: 0 1 auto` so they give way before
    the chord does (CH-D2). No chord: empty.
  - `margin-left: auto`: the playing section, 24 / 300, line-height 48, letter-spacing −0.5, in its
    hue (kit › Section names, Hue roles), no glow. Stopped: the Main to start on in `--m` (Stage
    D4). `flex: none`: it always shows whole.
- `aria-label` on the block: "Now playing: {style}, {tempo} BPM, {Running|Sync start|Stopped},
  chord {name} ({tones}), {section}" ("Now playing: Sunday Drive Pop, 104 BPM, Running, chord Am7
  (A C E G), Main B"); with no chord the chord part is the two words "no chord" ("…, Running, no
  chord, Main B").

### Parts list

`48,228 320×220` (16 below the compact block; header 24, 4, grid 192), a `nav`
`aria-label="Parts"`. The left column's remaining 116px below it (y 448 to 564) are empty.

- **Header** `48,228 320×24`: 24 tall, `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line)`, items centred,
  space between: "Parts" 14 `--m`; "Part " 13 `--m` then "{n} of 12" 13 `--t` (n = the open
  part + 1).
- **Grid** `48,256 320×192` (4 below): `repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr))`, rows 32, column gap 16 (cells
  152 × 32), row-major: R1 | R2, R3 | L, Rhythm 1 | Rhythm 2, Bass | Chord 1, Chord 2 | Pad,
  Phrase 1 | Phrase 2 (parts 0–11: `keyboardParts[0..3]`, then `mixer.styleParts[0..7]`).
- **Entry**, a text button: 32 tall, padding 0 8, radius 0, no border except
  `border-bottom: 1px solid` (`--line`; the open part: its hue), items centred, gap 8, left
  aligned, no wrap; `aria-current="true"` on the open part.
  - **Tag**, `min-width: 22px`, 13 / 500: "R1", "R2", "R3", "L" (fixed strings), then
    `styleParts[i].name` read from the state ("Rhythm 1", "Rhythm 2", "Bass", "Chord 1", "Chord
    2", "Pad", "Phrase 1", "Phrase 2" in the fixture). Colour: the part hue for a keyboard part (`--r1 --r2 --r3 --l`), `--t2`
    for a Style part (Style parts carry no hue); `--d` when the part doesn't sound (keyboard:
    `sounding` false; Style: `on` false).
  - **Name**, 14 / 400, `min-width: 0`, ellipsis: a keyboard part's sound name (Stage › Sounds
    row: `sound.name`, else `voiceName`; Left under Manual Bass: the Bass voice name, drawn as
    sounding), `--t`; `--m` when it doesn't sound. A Style part shows no name (CH-D3).
  - **Open part**: background the part's hue (a Style part: `--t2`), tag and name `--g`, bottom
    rule in the hue, whether or not the part sounds (the open face wins). Hooks: the entry
    carries `data-face="chosen"` when open (`off` otherwise); the tag carries `data-hue` on every
    entry: its colour's name (`r1`, `r2`, `r3`, `l`, `t2`, or `d` when it doesn't sound; the open
    entry's tag keeps its part's hue name).
  - Click: opens that part: the **part opener** (`ui.selectedPart = i`, `ui.page = 'channel'`; a
    keyboard part also sends `selectPart { part }`, as today's `channelNav.show`; the same opener
    serves ◀ ▶, the Stage's tags and strip names, and the health slot). Tooltip `channel.part`
    (new). `aria-label` "Part {n} of 12: {tag} {name}{, off}{, open}" (", off" when the part
    doesn't sound: the same condition as the `--d` tag; ", open" on the open part) ("Part 1 of
    12: R1 Stage Grand, open", "Part 3 of 12: R3 Brass Section, off"; a Style part: "Part 5 of
    12: Rhythm 1", or "Part 5 of 12: Rhythm 1, off" when muted).

### Part header

`417,128 975×36`: 36 tall, `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line)`, items centred, gap 12, no wrap.
The part is `keyboardParts[part]` (a Style part: #518). Everything is `flex: none` except the
sound name and the plugin line, which have `min-width: 0` and an ellipsis (the name gives way
first: the plugin line has `flex-shrink: 0.5`, the name 1). Left under Manual Bass
(`playsBass`) shows as the Stage's sound cell does: the Bass voice name, drawn as sounding,
"bass" after the marks, and ", bass" in the `aria-label`.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| "Channel" | 14 `--m`; not a control | — | — | — | — |
| Part block | padding 0 8, 14 / 500, line-height 22, `--g` on the part hue (`data-hue`); not a control | `keyboardParts[part].name` ("Right 1") | — | `mixer.channel` (the MIDI channel) | — |
| Sound | a text button, 32 tall, items on the baseline, gap 8: the number 12 `--m`, the name 16 `--t`, then the marks (kit › FaderStrip, name button marks: edited dot, ⚠, ✕; "off" 12 `--m` when `on` is false and the part doesn't sound, as Stage › Sounds row: a part silenced by another's solo shows no "off"). Not sounding: the number `--d`, the name `--m` (as the Stage's sound cell) | number and name as Stage › Sounds row (patch number from `soundLibrary.patches`, `sound.name` else `voiceName`) | opens the quick sound list for the part (#514; interim D32: Library › Sounds) | `launchkey.fader_sound` | — |

| Plugin line | 12 `--m`, hidden when `plugin` is absent; four spans in a row with no whitespace between them: the name span "{plugin.name} · " (`--m`), the **status span** (the status word, coloured and carrying `data-hue`: `loading` `--m` (`m`), `playing` `--ok` (`ok`), `failed` `--ending` (`ending`), `muted` `--warn` (`warn`)), then, when `outOfProcess` is false, the separator span " · " (`--m`) and the process span "in process" (`--m`) which, when `inProcessFallback`, starts with a 12px `--warn` ⚠ and a 3px gap ("⚠ in process"); `missing` true → the status span reads "missing" in `--warn` (`warn`), whatever `status` says, and the separator and process spans are not drawn | `keyboardParts[part].plugin` | not a control | `part.plugin` | — |
| Edit | off face, 26 tall, padding 0 10, 13px; shown only when `plugin.editor` | — | `app.pluginEditor(part, true)` (`app/src/lib/store.svelte.ts`, which forwards to the session's `pluginEditor`: the shell's `open_plugin_editor`; the dev mock's flips `soundEdited` and posts a message) | `part.plugin_edit` | — |
| CPU | `margin-left: auto`; "CPU " 13 `--m`, the number 16 / 300 `--t` in its own span, "%" 12 `--m`; not a control | the `meters.channels` entry whose `channel` equals `keyboardParts[part].channel`: `Math.round(cpu × 100)`; no such entry (no synth): the number span reads "—" in `--d` (`data-hue="d"`), "CPU " stays, "%" is not drawn | — | `mixer.cpu` | — |

`aria-label`s: sound "{part name} sound: {number }{name}{, edited}{, off}{, plugin missing | , plugin
failed}{, bass}. Opens the quick sound list" (Stage's template); Edit "Open the plugin editor"; ◀
"Previous part ({its tag})", ▶ "Next part ({its tag})" ("Previous part (Phrase 2)", "Next part
(R2)"). There is no close button and no × (CH-D4): the Stage tab, Alt+G or Esc (once nothing is
open over the page) goes back to the Stage.

### Groups

`417,176 975×380` (12 below the header): a grid `repeat(4, minmax(0, 1fr))`, gap 24 (columns
225.75 wide): **A** Mix and Sends, **B** EQ and Tone, **C** Compressor, **D** Inserts and Play.
Each column is a `min-width: 0` column with `overflow-y: auto; scrollbar-width: thin`; on the
board nothing scrolls, and a column scrolls only when its content exceeds 380 (CH-D5). Focus
rings inside a clipping box (a column, the compact block, the parts list) are the kit's 1px
outline drawn **inset** (`outline-offset: −1px`) instead of at the 2px offset, so no ring is
clipped; everywhere else the kit's offset applies. On the
board the columns' contents are A 356, B 380, C 344, D 368 tall. Within a column, rows follow
their group header and each other with **no gap** (the groups' 24px headers are not the kit's
36px group header, whose rule is 8px below); the only gaps are the ones given below (12 above
the Sends, Tone and Play headers and above C's note; 8 and 4 in C and D as listed). Every row
is 32 tall whatever it holds (a 28px lamp or button sits centred in its 32px row).

Three row shapes are used everywhere in the groups:

- **Group header**, 24 tall, `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line)`, the title 14 / 400 `--m`,
  line-height 22; items centred, gap 8; a small note after the title is 12 `--m`; a
  right-aligned part comes after `margin-left: auto`. (The Sends header alone is 32 tall, its
  button 31.)
- **Bar readout** (the `BarReadout` component), 32 tall, items centred, gap 10: the label 76
  wide, 14 / 400 `--t`, no wrap, `overflow: hidden`, ellipsis (an insert setting's
  "Sensitivity" or "Frequency" may end in one); the bar (`role="slider"`, `flex: 1`, 32 tall, `position:
  relative`, transparent, no border; about 72px wide at this column width); the **value slot**
  58 wide, right-aligned, no wrap, `overflow: hidden`, holding the value 18 / 300 `--t` and then
  the unit 12 / 400 `--m` with 2px left margin (no unit: nothing); a value and unit too wide for
  58px are clipped at the left. A value string that carries its own unit (an insert setting's
  `display`: "0.50 Hz", "40%", "12 ms", "1/8", "On") is split where its leading run of digits,
  signs, dots and slashes ends (`/^[-+−0-9./]+/`): that run is the value and the rest, with a
  leading space dropped, the unit ("0.50" · "Hz", "40" · "%", "12" · "ms", "1/8" · nothing); a
  string with no such run ("On") is all value, no unit. **While a drag, wheel or key edits any
  bar**, the value text and the fill follow the local value at once (a stepped row shows the
  step's Hz; a `display` row shows the local number as a bare value); the local value is kept
  while the pointer is down and, after pointerup or a wheel or key edit, until the first state
  whose value for the row equals the last one sent, or 500 ms after the last send, whichever
  comes first (so state frames mid-drag never snap the fill back). Inside the bar: the
  track `left 0, right 0, top 15, 2px` in `--track`; the fill 2px tall at top 15 in the part's
  hue from `fl%` for `fw%`; the cap `2 × 12` at top 10, left `calc(pct% − 1px)`, in the hue.
  `pct = round(f × 100)` where `f` is the control's fraction below. Unipolar: `fl = 0`, `fw =
  pct`. Bipolar (from the centre): `fl = min(50, pct)`, `fw = |pct − 50|`. **Disabled** (a send
  that isn't there): track `--mbg`, no fill, no cap, label and value `--d`, value "—",
  `aria-disabled="true"`, stays focusable, sends nothing. `data-hue` the part hue; `data-face`
  `off` or `disabled`.
- **Lamp**, LampButton `size cell` at a fixed width (72, 52) or, in the Play rows, `size sm`
  28 tall at 52 (kit › Faces: on = lamp face, off = `--btn` with `--m` label).

**The bar as a control** (every bar readout; CH-D6). `aria-label` the row's label text ("Level",
"Low freq", "Threshold", "Depth"; a send row "Send {n}, {label in lower case}"; the Portamento
row "Portamento"; never the ↕), `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`,
`aria-valuenow` in the control's own units as the state and command carry them (0–127, −12..12,
the frequency rows in Hz with min and max the table's ends, the Ratio row in tenths 10–200; a
disabled bar has no `aria-valuenow`) and `aria-valuetext` "{label}
{value}{ unit}" ("Level 90", "Low +2 dB", "Pan C"; the ":1" unit joins with no space: "Ratio
3:1"; the Level row adds ", hardware fader away" while `waiting`, as the kit's fader). Pointer:
press anywhere on the bar and drag
horizontally, relative (never a jump to the pointer), with pointer capture: `value = clamp(v0 +
trunc((x − x0) / 2), min, max)` with `v0`, `x0` the value and pointer x at pointerdown, `trunc`
toward zero, right positive (Shift held: `/ 8`, read from the pointer event's `shiftKey`, not
`ui.shift`: it is a fine-drag modifier, not the Launchkey's Shift layer); for a stepped control
(the EQ frequencies) the
same with steps of its table in place of units. A send goes out when the whole-number value
differs from the last one sent, at most once per animation frame (the latest value of that
frame); pointerup sends the final value only if it differs from the last sent, so a press with
no movement sends nothing. Wheel: one unit per notch, up (`deltaY < 0`) positive (a stepped
control: one step). Right and Up +1, Left and Down −1, PageUp/PageDown ±10 (a stepped control:
±1 and ±10 steps), Home/End the ends; `stopPropagation` as the kit's faders. Double-click resets
to the control's
default (given per row); a double-click sends the default even when the value is already there
(a reset is a deliberate act, and the command is idempotent). Cursor `ew-resize` while
dragging. Each change sends the row's command with the value filled in.

#### A · Mix and Sends

`417,176 225.75×380`.

| Row | Label | Reads | f | Value | Sends | Default | Tooltip |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mix header | "Mix" | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Level | "Level" | `keyboardParts[part].volume` | `v / 127` | `v` | `setPartVolume { part, volume }` | 100 | `mixer.channel.level` |
| Pan | "Pan" | `keyboardParts[part].pan` | `v / 127`, bipolar | `panText(v)`: "C", "L12", "R5" (`app/src/panels/channel/channel.ts`) | `setPartPan { part, pan }` | 64 | `mixer.channel.pan` |

Launchkey: Level is Panel fader `part + 1`; Pan is the Pan fader layer on that fader. While
`keyboardParts[part].waiting` the Level row's label reads "Level ↕" (the ↕ 13px `--m`, as the
strip's; tooltip then `mixer.pickup`).

Then a **lamp row** (no gap after Pan), 32 tall, gap 8: **On** (72 × 32) and **Solo** (72 × 32).

| Button | Label | On = | Click | Long press / right-click | Tooltip | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| On | "On" / "Off" (`keyboardParts[part].on`); "Swap" while this part's swap is held | `sounding` | `togglePart { part }` (in swap: `setLayer none`); Shift-click the same (the kit's Shift-click opens Channel, which is already open) | `setLayer { type: swap, part }`, latched until the next click (kit › Lamp row, Stage D12, D18) | `part.right1.on` … `part.left.on` by part | fader button `part + 1` |
| Solo | "Solo" | `mixer.partSolo === part` | lit: `setPartSolo { part: null }`; else `setPartSolo { part }` | — | `mixer.solo` | — |

`aria-label`s: "{part name} on" / "{part name} off" by `on` (plus ", swap held"), "Solo {part
name}".

Then, 12 below, the **Sends header**, 32 tall, hairline, space between: "Sends" 14 `--m` with
"1–6" 12 `--m` after it; **+ Add send**, a text button 31 tall, 14 `--t2`, the "+" at weight
300 (`aria-haspopup="listbox"`, `aria-expanded`): opens the kind menu (Groups › D, Kind menu)
with the twelve send kinds (Hall, Room, Stage, Plate, Chorus, Celeste, Flanger, Delay 1/8, Delay
1/8., Delay 1/4, Ping-Pong, Phaser: `SEND_KINDS` in `app/src/panels/effects/sendKinds.ts`, in
its order, each entry's `name`; none is current, so the cursor starts on the first); picking one sends `addSend { kind }`. Disabled
(`aria-disabled`, `--d`) when six sends exist. Tooltip `channel.add_send` (new). `aria-label`
"Add a send effect ({n} of 6)" with n = the number of sends + 1; full: "Add a send effect: all
six added".

Then six **send rows** (bar readouts), sends 1–6 (`send` 0–5). "Send i exists" means
`effects.sends` has an entry whose `send` field is `i` (look up by that field, not by array
index):

| Row | Label | Reads | f | Value | Sends | Default | Tooltip |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Send 1–3 | "Reverb", "Chorus", "Delay" (the buses; CH-D7) | `strip.sends[i]` | `v / 127` | `v` | `setStripSend { strip: part, send: i, level }` | 0 | `mixer.strip.send` |
| Send 4–6, there | that entry's `name` ("Phaser", "Plate", "Delay 1/8."), ellipsis | as above | | | | 0 | `mixer.strip.send` |
| Send 4–6, not there | "Send 5", "Send 6" | — | disabled face | "—" | nothing | — | `mixer.strip.send` |

Launchkey: sends 1–3 are the Reverb, Chorus and Delay fader layers on the part's fader; send 4
is swap knob 8; sends 5–6 have none (the rack's controller map can target them).
`aria-valuetext` "Send {n}, {label in lower case}, {v}" ("Send 1, reverb, 40", "Send 4, phaser,
20", "Send 6, delay 1/8., 0"); a missing send's `aria-valuetext` and `aria-label` are both

#### B · EQ and Tone

`666.75,176 225.75×380` (the grid's second column).

| Row | Label | Reads | f | Value · unit | Sends | Default | Tooltip |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EQ header | "EQ" | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Low | "Low" | `strip.eq.lowGain` (−12..12 dB, an integer) | `0.5 + g / 24`, bipolar | `dbText(g)` "+2", "0", "−1" · "dB" | `setStripEq { strip: part, eq: withEq(eq, { lowGain }) }` | 0 | `mixer.strip.eq_low_gain` |
| Low freq | "Low freq" | `strip.eq.lowFreq` (Hz) | `stepOf(LOW_STEPS, hz) / 36` | `hzUnit(hz)` | `setStripEq` with `lowFreq: LOW_STEPS[step]` | 80 | `mixer.strip.eq_low_freq` |
| High | "High" | `strip.eq.highGain` | `0.5 + g / 24`, bipolar | `dbText(g)` · "dB" | `setStripEq` with `highGain` | 0 | `mixer.strip.eq_high_gain` |
| High freq | "High freq" | `strip.eq.highFreq` | `stepOf(HIGH_STEPS, hz) / 30` | `hzUnit(hz)` | `setStripEq` with `highFreq: HIGH_STEPS[step]` | 10000 | `mixer.strip.eq_high_freq` |

`LOW_STEPS` (37 steps, 32 Hz–2 kHz), `HIGH_STEPS` (31 steps, 500 Hz–16 kHz), `stepOf`, `dbText`
and `withEq` are in `app/src/panels/mixer/eq.ts` (the build copies them to
`app/src/ui/BarReadout/eq.ts`; the old file stays until the old mixer goes: Gap against today). `hzUnit(hz)` (new, beside them): below 1000, the integer and "Hz" ("120" ·
"Hz"); from 1000, `(hz / 1000).toFixed(1)` and "kHz" ("8.0" · "kHz", "1.2" · "kHz", "16.0" ·
"kHz"). The value shows the state's Hz as it is (120 is not a step but shows "120"); a drag
or wheel moves to the nearest step first, then steps (CH-D8). The board's "+2.0" and "−1.5"
gains are placeholders: gains are whole dB.

Then, 12 below, the **Tone header**: "Tone" 14 `--m` with "offsets on the sound" 12 `--m`;
right: **More ›** / **‹ Less**, a text button 23 tall, 13 `--t2`, `aria-expanded`: toggles the
two extra rows (app-only state, `ui.channelToneMore`, false at start; CH-D5). Tooltip
`channel.tone_more` (new). `aria-label` "More tone settings: vibrato rate and vibrato delay" /
"Fewer tone settings".

Tone rows: each `strip.tone[control]`, 0–127 with 64 the voice's own, **bipolar** `f = v /
127`, value `toneText(v)` ("+12", "0", "−4"; `channel.ts`), no unit, sends `setStripTone {
strip: part, control, value }`, default 64:

| Row | Label | `control` | Tooltip |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Cutoff" | `cutoff` | `mixer.channel.tone.cutoff` |
| 2 | "Resonance" | `resonance` | `mixer.channel.tone.resonance` |
| 3 | "Attack" | `attack` | `mixer.channel.tone.attack` |
| 4 | "Decay" | `decay` | `mixer.channel.tone.decay` |
| 5 | "Release" | `release` | `mixer.channel.tone.release` |
| 6 | "Vibrato" | `vibratoDepth` | `mixer.channel.tone.vibrato_depth` |
| 7 (More) | "Vib rate" | `vibratoRate` | `mixer.channel.tone.vibrato_rate` |
| 8 (More) | "Vib delay" | `vibratoDelay` | `mixer.channel.tone.vibrato_delay` |

The board draws Vibrato unipolar from 0; it is bipolar like the others (64 = the voice's own,
"0"; CH-D9). Launchkey: none (the rack's controller map can target the tone controls).

#### C · Compressor

`916.5,176 225.75×380`.

- **Header**, 24 tall, hairline, gap 8: "Compressor" 14 `--m`; "Edited" 12 / 500 `--t` when
  `strip.comp.edited`, else nothing.
- **Lamp row**, 8 below, 32 tall, gap 8: **On** (LampButton `cell`, 72 × 32; the label reads
  "On" in both states; on = `comp.on`; sends `setStripCompressorOn { strip: part, on: !on }`;
  tooltip `mixer.strip.comp`; `aria-label` "Compressor on" / "Compressor off"), then "no
  gain-reduction meter" 12 `--m` (fixed text; DECISIONS M8).
- **Preset tabs**, 8 below, a `role="tablist"` `aria-label="Compressor preset"`, wrapping,
  row-gap 4, no column gap: five `role="tab"` buttons, 26 tall, padding 0 8, 14 / 400, no wrap,
  no radius: Natural, Rich, Punchy, Electronic, Loud (`COMP_PRESETS` order). The chosen one
  (`comp.preset`, `aria-selected="true"`) is the chosen face (`--t` fill, `--g` label, weight
  400 here, not 500: the board's; `data-face="chosen"`); the rest `--m` on nothing, no border
  (the kit's inactive page-tab look; `data-face="off"`). On the board they wrap into two
  rows (Natural Rich Punchy / Electronic Loud). Click, Enter or Space sends
  `setStripCompressorPreset { strip: part, preset }`, on the chosen tab too (it puts the type's
  parameters back when `edited`). Roving `tabindex` (the chosen tab is the tab stop); Left/Right
  move focus only, no wrap, with `stopPropagation` so the global ← → (`stepStyle`) don't fire.
  Tooltip `mixer.strip.comp_type` on each.
- **Rows**, 8 below, five bar readouts (`strip.comp`), each sending `setStripCompressorParam {
  strip: part, param, value }`; double-click resets to the chosen preset's value. The presets
  (the engine's `preset_params` in `crates/yahaha-fx/src/fx/part_comp.rs`): Natural −18 dB,
  2.5:1, 10 ms, 200 ms; Rich −20, 2.0, 30, 400; Punchy −24, 6.0, 5, 120; Electronic −22, 4.0, 3,
  100; Loud −30, 8.0, 2, 150; make-up 0 dB on every type (app-api.md's "Strip compressor types"
  table still says +3…+9 dB: stale, see Follow-ups). The app has no table of these yet
  (`COMP_PRESETS` in `types.ts` is the Master compressor's), so `STRIP_COMP_PRESETS` goes in
  `app/src/ui/BarReadout/eq.ts` beside `ratioText`:

| Row | Label | `param` | Range | f | Value · unit | Tooltip |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Threshold" | `threshold` | −48..0 dB | `(v + 48) / 48` | `dbText(v)` · "dB" ("−18") | `mixer.strip.comp_threshold` |
| 2 | "Ratio" | `ratio` | 10–200 tenths | `(v − 10) / 190` | `ratioText(v)` · ":1": `v / 10` with no decimal when whole, else one ("3", "2.5", "6") | `mixer.strip.comp_ratio` |
| 3 | "Attack" | `attack` | 1–100 ms | `(v − 1) / 99` | `v` · "ms" | `mixer.strip.comp_attack` |
| 4 | "Release" | `release` | 10–1000 ms | `(v − 10) / 990` | `v` · "ms" | `mixer.strip.comp_release` |
| 5 | "Make-up" | `makeup` | 0–24 dB | `v / 24` | `v` · "dB" | `mixer.strip.comp_makeup` |

- **Note**, 12 below: "Presets start at 0 dB make-up; add your own." 13 / 400, line-height 18,
  `--m`, wrapping (two lines at this width). Fixed text (DECISIONS S11, the engine's unity
  make-up).

The compressor off: the rows stay as drawn and still edit (the board shows no off look; CH-D10).
Launchkey: none.

#### D · Inserts and Play

`1166.25,176 225.75×380`.

- **Header**, 24 tall, hairline, gap 8: "Inserts" 14 `--m`; `margin-left: auto`; **Rotary
  fast**, a LampButton 22 tall, padding 0 10, 12px, radius 4 (`size xs`): on = `effects.rotaryFast`;
  sends `toggleRotaryFast`; tooltip `fx.rotary_fast`; `aria-label` "Rotary fast, global: the
  rotary speed for every part"; then "global" 12 `--m`. Launchkey: Shift + encoder page ▲ (its
  tooltip's `launchkey` line is `null` today; CH-C1 adds it, as the Effects spec's FXC1 does).
- **Slot 1**, 8 below, a row 32 tall, gap 8: "1" 12 `--m`, 12 wide; the **kind button**
  (`flex: 1`, 32 tall, off face, padding 0 10, 14px, items centred, space between: the kind's
  `name` in `--t` (`--m` for "None"), then "▼" 10px `--m`); the **On** lamp (LampButton `cell`
  52 × 32, the label "On" in both states, on = `on`, sends `setStripInsertOn { strip: part, slot,
  on: !on }`, tooltip `mixer.strip.insert_on`, `aria-label` "Insert {n} on" / "Insert {n} off"),
  shown only when the slot has a kind (`kind` not `none`).
- **Settings**, 4 below (the 4px only when at least one setting row follows; an empty slot or
  a kind with no rows adds no gap, which is how column D comes to 368), one bar readout per
  `settings[j]` (0–3, in order): label
  `settings[j].name` ("Depth", "Drive", "Balance"), `f = (value − min) / (max − min)`,
  unipolar, value `settings[j].display` as the state gives it ("64", "1/8", "0.50 Hz", "40%"),
  split into value and unit by the rule above, sends `setStripInsertSetting { strip: part,
  slot, setting: j, value }`, default `settings[j].default`, tooltip `mixer.strip.insert_setting_1` …
  `_4` by index. The board's "Balance 0" from the centre is a placeholder: Balance 64 reads
  "64" from the left (CH-D11). An unknown kind (a newer build's) shows its name and no rows.
- **Slot 2**, 8 below: the same row for `inserts[1]`; empty on the board ("None", no On lamp).
- **Play header**, 12 below, 24 tall, hairline: "Play" 14 `--m`.
- **Play rows**, 32 tall each, label 76 wide 14 `--t`, gap 10 (the Octave and Bend rows gap 8):

| Row | Control | Reads | Face / value | Sends | Tooltip |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mono | LampButton `size sm` 52 × 28, label "On" / "Off" | `strip.mono` | lamp on / off | `setStripMono { strip: part, on: !mono }` | `mixer.channel.mono` |
| Portamento | bar readout (`flex: 1`), value 58 wide, no unit; default (double-click) 0 | `strip.portamento.time`, shown whatever `on` is (a rack can leave time > 0 with `on` false) | `f = time / 127`, unipolar; value `time` | `setStripPortamento { strip: part, on: time > 0, time }` with the new time (CH-D12) | `mixer.channel.portamento` |
| Octave | **−** (32 × 28 off face, 14px), the value `flex: 1` centred 18 / 300 `--t`, **+** | `keyboardParts[part].octave` (−2..2) | `octaveLabel(o)` "+1", "0", "−2" (`app/src/panels/parts/parts.ts`) | − `setPartOctave { part, octave: o − 1 }`, disabled at −2; + `… o + 1`, disabled at 2 | `part.octave_down`, `part.octave_up` |
| Bend | −, value, + as Octave; the value then "st" 12 `--m` with 2px margin | `controllers.parts[part].bendRange` (0–12) | `b` · "st" | − `setBendRange { part, semitones: b − 1 }`, disabled at 0; + `… b + 1`, disabled at 12 | `pedal.bend_down`, `pedal.bend_up` |

`aria-label`s: "Mono on" / "Mono off"; Portamento's `aria-valuetext` "Portamento time {t}"
plus ", off" while `portamento.on` is false ("Portamento time 0, off"; "Portamento time 40,
off" for a rack's switched-off glide); "Octave down" / "Octave up" with the value span
`role="status"` and `aria-label` "Octave {octaveLabel(o)}" ("Octave +1", "Octave 0"); "Bend
range down" / "Bend range up", the value span `role="status"` with `aria-label` "Bend range {b}
semitones". Launchkey: none
(the Octave and Bend have none on the hardware; swap knob 7 is insert 1's first setting).

**Kind menu** (the `KindMenu` component, new; CH-D13). The insert kind button
(`aria-haspopup="listbox"`, `aria-expanded`) and + Add send open a popover `role="listbox"`
(`aria-label` "Insert {n} kind" or "Send kind") in the **overlay layer**: a `position: absolute; inset: 0; pointer-events: none` div at the
root of the `Channel` component, last in its DOM and above everything else in it, positioned in
the 1440 × 900 coordinates (so the D1 scaler scales it with the page and no column clips it);
the popover itself has `pointer-events: auto`, so clicks elsewhere reach the page as usual and
"a click outside" is any pointerdown whose target is not inside the popover (a document
listener while it is open; that click also does what it would have done anyway). The popover's top edge sits on the
button's bottom edge (gap 0), it is the button's width (Add send: 160 wide, its right edge on
the button's right edge), `--btn` fill, radius 4, 4px padding, `box-shadow: none`. It may cover
the half band. When its bottom would pass y 876 (the key strip's bottom) it opens upward, its
bottom edge on the button's top edge; its height is capped so it stays inside y 112 to 876
(then its list scrolls, `overflow-y: auto; scrollbar-width: thin`). On the board: the
seven-kind insert menu (232 tall) opens downward from slot 1 (its row y 208 to 240: the menu y
240 to 472) and from slot 2 (row y 348 to 380: the menu y 380 to 612); the twelve-kind send
menu (392 tall) opens downward from + Add send (the button y 308 to 339 inside its 32px header:
the menu y 339 to 731).
One `role="option"` per kind, 32 tall, padding 0 10, 14 / 400 `--t2`, no wrap; the current kind
(`aria-selected="true"`) `--t` weight 500; the option under the pointer or the keyboard cursor
`background: var(--line)` (the one hover look the kit allows, because a menu needs a cursor;
CH-D13). Opening: click, Enter, Space or ArrowDown on the button; focus moves to the listbox,
which tracks the cursor with `aria-activedescendant`; the cursor starts on the current kind
(Add send: on the first). A click on the button while its menu is open is a click outside: it
closes the menu and does not reopen it (the button toggles). Click, Enter or Space on an option
other than the current kind sends the row's command and closes; on the current kind it only
closes (so re-picking Rotary doesn't reset its settings); Esc, a click outside or Tab closes
without sending; Up/Down move the cursor without wrapping, Home/End to the ends. The listbox
calls `stopPropagation` on every key it handles (the arrows, Home, End, Enter, Space, Esc and
Tab), so the global handler never sees them (Esc in the menu never leaves the page). After Esc
or a pick, focus returns to the button; after
a click outside it goes where the click took it; Tab and Shift+Tab close the menu and move
focus to the element after or before the **button** in the tab order (the menu intercepts the
key and focuses that element itself, since the popover sits at the end of the DOM). Insert kinds, in order
(`INSERT_KINDS` in `channel.ts`): None,
Distortion, Compressor, Auto Wah, Tremolo, Rotary, Phaser; a slot whose kind this build doesn't
know lists it too, last, by its own name. Tooltip on the button and on every option: the
button's key (`mixer.strip.insert_kind`; Add send's `channel.add_send`), since the catalog test
counts `role="option"` as interactive. The button's `aria-label` "Insert {n} kind: {name}.
Choose None, Distortion, Compressor, Auto Wah, Tremolo, Rotary or Phaser".

## Half band, key row and status on the Channel

The Kit additions below, unchanged; the Channel adds nothing to them. The faders, lamps,
knobs, pads and transport read and send exactly as the full band's (kit › Full band); only the
geometry differs. The fader page, layer, knob page and pad page are whatever the state says, as
on the Stage.

## States

| State | What changes |
|---|---|
| Playing, Right 1 open (the board) | as drawn |
| Another keyboard part open | the header block, parts-list entry and every bar's hue follow the part (`--r2`, `--r3`, `--l`); the rows read that part's state |
| A Style part open | spec #518 (Channel-StylePart). Until it lands (CH-D14): the same page with `mixer.styleParts[p]` (`p = part − 4`) and its `strip`; the block and bars in `--t2`; Level reads `styleParts[p].volume` (↕ from its `waiting`) and sends `setStylePartVolume { part: p, volume }` (tooltip `mixer.style.volume`); On lit from `styleParts[p].on` (the state already folds Manual Bass in), click `toggleStylePart { part: p }`, no long press (tooltip `mixer.style.mute`); Solo lit when `mixer.styleSolo === p`, click `setStyleSolo { part: p }` or `{ part: null }` when lit (tooltip `mixer.solo`); the Part block reads `styleParts[p].name` ("Rhythm 1"); the Pan row disabled ("—"); the sound is a plain readout, not a button: `voice.label` 16 `--t` (null voice: "—" in `--d`), no number, Mine, plugin line or Edit (tooltip `mixer.strip.voice`); CPU from channel `styleParts[p].channel`; the Tone rows disabled ("—"); the Play rows disabled: Mono's lamp `aria-disabled` with label "Off", Portamento's bar disabled ("—"), Octave's and Bend's steppers `aria-disabled` with the value "—" in `--d` (a Style part has no `controllers.parts` entry); every disabled bar keeps its `aria-label`, has `aria-valuetext` "{label}, not available" ("Pan, not available", "Cutoff, not available", "Portamento, not available") and no `aria-valuenow`; the disabled stepper values are named "Octave, not available" and "Bend range, not available"; sends 1–6 as `setStripSend { strip: part }`; the EQ rows as `setStripEq { strip: part }`; the Compressor group unchanged (`setStripCompressor* { strip: part }`); **the Inserts group unchanged and live** (CH-D23): slot 1 is the style's insertion effect for the part (`styleParts[p].strip.inserts[0]`: kind, On, settings), slot 2 the strip's own, both editing with `setStripInsertKind` / `On` / `Setting { strip: part, … }`, which the API maps onto `setPartInsertOn` and `setPartInsertAmount` (slot 0's On and setting 0); a part whose style gives no insert shows "None" in slot 1, as a keyboard part's empty slot |
| Stopped | compact block: run dot hidden, section in `--m` (Stage D4); count row and band as the Stage's Stopped state |
| Sync Start armed | compact run dot a hollow ring, "Sync start"; count row and pad 4 as the Stage's |
| Part off (`on` false, not sounding) | On lamp off ("Off"); parts-list tag `--d`, name `--m`; the sound cell's "off" mark; the strip in the band as kit › FaderStrip, Part off. Every row still edits |
| Part soloed (`mixer.partSolo` = part) | Solo lit; the other keyboard parts don't sound (their lamps off, strips dimmed) |
| Another part soloed | Solo off here; this part's `sounding` false: as Part off, plus the solo lamp of that part lit in its own channel |
| Swap held for this part | On reads "Swap"; knob block "Swap R1" (kit › Knobs) |
| Fader `waiting` | Level row "Level ↕"; the strip's ghost in the band |
| Compressor off | On lamp off; rows unchanged (CH-D10) |
| Compressor edited | "Edited" after the header title; the preset tab stays on `comp.preset` |
| Insert slot empty | "None" in `--m`, no On lamp, no setting rows |
| Insert 2 filled | its On lamp and setting rows appear; column D scrolls when over 380 (CH-D5) |
| Tone More | two more rows; column B scrolls (CH-D5) |
| Six sends | + Add send disabled; no "Send n" rows |
| Three sends (fresh session) | rows 4–6 disabled "Send 4", "Send 5", "Send 6" |
| Plugin loading / failed / muted / missing | the plugin line's word and colour (Part header); failed: ✕ on the sound; missing: ⚠ and "missing" |
| No plugin (SoundFont voice) | no plugin line, no Edit, no Mine unless the patch is in My Sounds |
| No chord | "—" and no tones in the compact block |
| No synth (`io.synth` null) | CPU "—"; health slot "Audio off"; meters empty |
| Pads on another page, Sound held, Help mode, No Launchkey, notices | as Stage › States (the half band uses the kit's fallback faces, D33) |
| Light theme | tokens only (kit › Tokens); `--ba` is `none`, so the compact chord doesn't glow |

## Board fixture

The state and moment that reproduce the board, for the `Pages/Channel` › `Board` story and its
shots: `app/src/ui/Channel/Channel.fixtures.ts` exports `boardState` (a full `AppState`),
`boardUi` (the app-only state: `{ page: 'channel', selectedPart: 0, channelToneMore: false,
keyRange: 61 }`), `boardNow` and `boardMeterHolds`. `boardState` starts from the Stage's
`boardState` (`app/src/ui/Stage/Stage.fixtures.ts`: the same moment, clock, style, transport,
chord, OTS, rack, parts, faders, meters, holds, lamps, knobs, pads, keys and I/O) and changes or
adds only what follows. `boardNow` and `boardMeterHolds` are the Stage's. Fields not listed take
the Stage fixture's, then the dev mock's. No kind menu is open.

- `keyboardParts[0]` (Right 1): on, sounding, selected true, volume 90, waiting false, pan 64,
  octave 0, channel 1; the older mirrors agree with the strip (app-api.md › strips): `reverb` 40,
  `chorus` 12, `variation` 0, `eq` the strip's, `insert` `{ effect: "rotary", on: true, amount:
  64 }`; `sound` `{ id: "saved:stage-grand", name: "Stage Grand" }`, with a `soundLibrary.patches`
  entry of that id, number 1; `soundEdited` absent; `plugin` `{ id: "aumu Smp7 Fake", name:
  "Sampler Deluxe", manufacturer: "Fake Instruments" (the dev mock's plugin,
  `app/src/lib/api/mock-plugins.ts`), status: "playing", stage: null, error: null, outOfProcess:
  false, inProcessFallback: false, cpu: 0.03, overruns: 0, recentOverruns: 0, editor: true,
  missing: false }`.
- `keyboardParts[0].strip`: `eq` { lowGain 2, lowFreq 120, highGain −2, highFreq 8000 }; `comp` {
  on true, preset "punchy", threshold −18, ratio 30, attack 10, release 120, makeup 0, edited
  true }; `inserts[0]` { kind "rotary", name "Rotary", on true, settings [Depth 0–127 default 64
  value 64 "64", Drive 0–127 default 0 value 20 "20", Balance 0–127 default 64 value 64 "64"] };
  `inserts[1]` { kind "none", name "None", on false, settings [] }; `sends` [40, 12, 0, 20, 0,
  0]; `tone` { cutoff 76, resonance 68, attack 64, decay 64, release 72, vibratoRate 64,
  vibratoDepth 64, vibratoDelay 64 }; `mono` false; `portamento` { on false, time 0 }.
- `controllers.parts[0].bendRange` 2. `mixer.partSolo` null, `styleSolo` null.
- `effects.sends`: four: send 0 kind "hall" name "Hall" (fromStyle true), 1 "chorus" "Chorus",
  2 "dottedEighth" "Delay 1/8." (both fromStyle), 3 "phaser" "Phaser" (setByRack true); each
  with its kind's params at the defaults and returnLevel 64. `effects.rotaryFast` true.
- `mixer.styleParts[0..7]`: names Rhythm 1, Rhythm 2, Bass, Chord 1, Chord 2, Pad, Phrase 1,
  Phrase 2, all `on` true (the parts list's Style tags are `--t2`).
- `meters.channels[0]` (channel 1): `cpu` 0.03 (the Stage fixture's peak and rms), `cpuPeak`
  0.05.
- **The half band** reads the Stage fixture's `surface.faders`, `meters`, `boardMeterHolds`,
  lamps, `knobs` and `pads` unchanged; at the half scale the meter heights are, strips 1–9 peak
  [rms] in px: 27 [25], 20 [18], — (strip 3 is off: no meter, no tick), 22 [20], 31 [29], 0 [0],
  —, —, 32 [29]; the held-peak tick bottoms (3 + height): 34, 27, —, 29, 37, 8, —, —, 38; the
  cap tops (`round((1 − v/127) × 44) + 18`): 31, 37, 40, 34, 27, 31, —, —, 27; strip 2's ghost at
  top `round((1 − 50/127) × 44) + 19 = 46`. Pads: 10 Playing, 11 Next, 16 Playing in `--ok`, 3
  and 7 Absent. Pads header "Sections · next Main C".
- **The key row** reads the Stage fixture's `keyboard`: split F#2 (54), detection [0, 54]
  ("lower"), held left 43, 45, 48, 52 → "G A C E", held right 76, 81 → "E4 A4", 61 keys;
  `message` null (the status line is empty).

Board texts that differ from this fixture on purpose: the count row's "fill after bar 4" (Stage
D5) is the one masked item (it keeps its `data-shot-mask="when"`, and the story masks it as the
Stage's does); the rest are under the screenshot diff's per-pixel threshold and have no mask:
the EQ gains "+2.0" and
"−1.5" (the fixture draws "+2" and "−2"); the Balance "0" (the fixture draws "64"); the One
Touch aria text. The board's bar fills are placeholder fractions (Threshold 0.55, High freq 0.7,
Vibrato from 0): the fixture draws them from the maths above, a few pixels away. The light
board's `--m` (`#6e6e6e`) and `--lamp-ink` (`#111`) differ from the tokens as on the Stage.

## Components

Every part of the screen, in build order; "Stage" in the Exists column means the component is
Stage.md's (built by that lane, reused as is) and this spec adds a size or variant where it says
so. Each new one gets `app/src/ui/<Name>/` with a SPEC.md per `docs/factory/spec-template.md`;
board lines are dark / light (light = dark − 36 on this board pair); crop boxes are the boxes in
this spec and the Kit additions.

Components take props and call callbacks; none reads `app.state` or sends. The page wiring
(`app/src/pages/ChannelWiring.svelte`, outside `app/src/ui`; Stage D46) reads `app.state`, keeps
`now`, `receivedMs` and the meter holds, opens parts, and maps each callback to its command or
interim target. Stage D46 has `StageWiring.svelte` keep `now`, `receivedMs` and the holds
itself; the Channel build moves that clock into a shared module, `app/src/pages/clock.svelte.ts`,
and has both wirings use it (CH-D22: one copy, never two). The part-select opener (CH-D15) is
app-level, `app/src/pages/partSelect.svelte.ts`, mounted by `App.svelte` whatever the page,
since it must fire while Channel isn't shown.

**Props and callbacks of `Channel`** (the page component; the story and the wiring share this
interface, and every prop is plain data):

| Prop | Type | From |
|---|---|---|
| `state` | `AppState` | `app.state` (`boardState` in the story) |
| `ui` | `{ page, selectedPart: number, channelToneMore: boolean, keyRange: 49 \| 61 \| 88 \| null, shift: boolean, help: boolean }` | the `ui` store's fields (`boardUi` in the story, with `shift` and `help` false) |
| `now` | `number` | the clock module (`boardNow`) |
| `receivedMs` | `number` | the clock module (the Stage fixture's) |
| `meterHolds` | the Stage's `MeterHolds` | the clock module (`boardMeterHolds`) |
| `menu` | `null \| { kind: 'insert', slot: 0 \| 1 } \| { kind: 'send' }` | which kind menu is open; the wiring keeps it in a local `$state`, the story sets it (`null` on the board) |

| Callback | Signature | The wiring maps it to |
|---|---|---|
| `onsend` | `(cmd: AppCmd) => void` | `app.send` (every command the tables give) |
| `onopenpart` | `(part: number) => void` | the part opener (`ui.selectedPart`, `ui.page = 'channel'`, `selectPart` for a keyboard part) |
| `onpage` | `(page) => void` | `ui.page = page` (the tabs) |
| `onnav` | `(target: InterimTarget) => void` | the Stage D32 interim targets (Browser, Library › Sounds, the Rack drawer, the health slot's target) |
| `onplugineditor` | `(part: number) => void` | `app.pluginEditor(part, true)` |
| `ontonemore` | `(more: boolean) => void` | `ui.channelToneMore = more` |
| `onkeyrange` | `(n: 49 \| 61 \| 88) => void` | `ui.setKeyRange(n)` |
| `onmenu` | `(menu) => void` | the wiring's `menu` state (open, close) |
| `onclearmessage` | `() => void` | the status line's clear (kit › Status line) |

The band's and key strip's own callbacks (fader, knob, pad, transport and key presses) all go
through `onsend`, as the Stage's do.

**Tab order** (kit › Interaction conventions, reading order): app bar (rack readout, One Touch,
tabs, health slot), section row, the compact block's style name, the parts list (row-major),
the part header left to right (sound, Edit, ◀, ▶), then columns A, B, C, D each top to bottom
(a column's lamps and buttons in their row order, left to right), then the half band (fader
header tabs, strips, lamp row, Track, knob ▲ ▼ and knobs, pad ▲ ▼ and pads, transport), then
the key row (the status line's button when it has a message, the size button).

## Gap against today

| Area | In `app/src` now | Change |
|---|---|---|
| The view | `panels/channel/ChannelView.svelte`: a row of cards (Level with a fader and its own 100 ms meter poll, EQ, Compressor, two Inserts, Sends, Tone, Play) with `FxKnob`s, `<select>`s and `Toggle`s, shown in the display's place by `panels/channel/nav.svelte.ts` (`show`, `close`, `stripClick`, Esc) | Replaced by the page above: a tab (`ui.page` `channel`, Stage D2), no close, no own meter poll (the band's strips show the part's meter); bar readouts and lamps instead of knobs, selects and toggles; the parts list instead of ‹ › alone (‹ › stay). `App.svelte` mounts `ChannelWiring` inside the D1 scaler when `ui.page` is `channel`. `channel.ts`: `TONE_KNOBS` is rewritten to the Tone row table (captions "Cutoff", "Resonance", "Attack", "Decay", "Release", "Vibrato", "Vib rate", "Vib delay", in that order; `ChannelView` goes with it); `toneText`, `STRIP_COUNT`, `INSERT_KINDS`, `INSERT_SETTING_TIPS`, `panText` stay; `meterFrac` goes (the kit's `height`). `ui.channelToneMore` is a plain `$state` on `ui` in `lib/store.svelte.ts`, not remembered |
| Opening | `nav.svelte.ts` `show(part)` from a strip name, Stage sound tags, the health slot; `stripClick` toggles; `escape()` | `show(part)` becomes the part opener (`ui.selectedPart`, `ui.page = 'channel'`, `selectPart` for a keyboard part), so the Stage's openers (Stage D32 interim row for Channel) open the page without changing; `close()` and `escape()` set `ui.page = 'stage'` (Esc when nothing is open over the page); `stripClick` goes with the old mixer row. A hardware part select opens it too (CH-D15, CH-C2) from `partSelect.svelte.ts` |
| EQ maths | `panels/mixer/eq.ts` (`LOW_STEPS`, `HIGH_STEPS`, `stepOf`, `hzText`, `dbText`, `gainKnob`, `withEq`), imported by `Strip.svelte` (a hotspot) | Copied to `app/src/ui/BarReadout/eq.ts` (`LOW_STEPS`, `HIGH_STEPS`, `stepOf`, `dbText`, `withEq`) with `hzUnit` and `ratioText` added; the old file stays until the old mixer goes |
| Half band | none (the Stage lane builds the full band) | The half sizes of FaderStrip, Knob, Pad, the LampRow at 12px and the five-row transport (Kit additions) |
| Key row | `panels/keystrip/KeyStrip.svelte`'s cheek (chord tones, 49/61/88 switch) | The readouts and the 49/61/88 button move to the key row's status line (Stage D25) |
| Shortcuts | `lib/nav.ts`, `lib/keys.ts` | Alt+N opens Channel for `ui.selectedPart` (Stage D37); F1–F4 (`part.*.select`) keep selecting and now open Channel (CH-D15) |
| Screenshot tool | `scripts/shots.ts` | Needs the Stage lane's per-story viewport and masks (Stage D39); nothing more |

## Contract changes needed

CH-C1 blocks the build (tooltip keys type-check and the catalog test). CH-C2 doesn't block;
until it lands the screen behaves as its row says.

1. **CH-C1 · Tooltips** (`app/src/help/tooltips.ts`, `app/docs/controls.md`), **lands before the
   build**: new keys `channel.part` (a parts-list entry: opens that part's channel; a keyboard
   part becomes the edited part), `channel.add_send` (adds a send effect 4–6 of the kind you
   pick; the rack keeps it), `channel.tone_more` (shows vibrato rate and delay), `channel.sound_mine`
   (this sound is in My Sounds), `keystrip.readout` (one body for the Split, Detect, Left and
   Right readouts: what each reads). Rewrites: `mixer.channel.level` and `mixer.channel.pan`
   ("drag sideways", not "up or down"; pan: "double-click for centre" stays), `mixer.channel.prev`
   ("Opens the part before this one (after Right 1 comes Phrase 2)") and `.next` ("Opens the
   part after this one (after Phrase 2 comes Right 1)"; each keeps its own parenthesis, "view"
   becomes "opens"),
   `mixer.channel.portamento` (one control: "the glide time between notes, 0–127; 0 is off"),
   `mixer.strip.insert_setting_1`–`_4` ("drag sideways"), `mixer.cpu` (no "pk" here: "this
   part's share of the audio buffer over the last second"), `keystrip.range` (a click steps 49 →
   61 → 88 → 49; it no longer mentions "the lit one"), `mixer.strip.select` (the strip name
   "opens the part's channel", the wording kit › Faders and Stage › Sounds row give the strip
   name and the tag). Launchkey fields:
   `mixer.channel.level` "Panel fader 1–4"; `mixer.strip.send` "Reverb, Chorus and Delay fader
   layers (sends 1–3); swap knob 8 (send 4)"; `mixer.channel.pan` "Pan fader layer, fader 1–4";
   `fx.rotary_fast` "Shift + encoder page ▲" (the same line the Effects spec's FXC1 adds;
   whichever lands first). `part.right1.select` … `part.left.select` gain "and opens its
   Channel page" (CH-D15). `mixer.channel.close` and
   `mixer.channel.portamento_time` are dropped by the Channel build PR itself, with
   `ChannelView.svelte` and its tests (they still use them, so the contract PR can't). The
   tooltip coverage test (`app/src/help/coverage.test.ts`) gains the Channel page and an open
   kind menu in its `STATES` in the build PR too.
2. **CH-C2 · Hardware part select opens Channel** (session, `src/api`, `docs/app-api.md`,
   `tests/fixtures/state.json`, `app/src/lib/api/types.ts`, both mocks): the state doesn't say
   what selected a part, so the screen can't tell Shift + fader button 1–4 from a rack load that
   changes `selected`. Add `surface.partSelectSeq: number`, incremented by the session on each
   hardware part select (Shift + fader button 1–4), so the wiring opens Channel on a change of it.
   Until then `partSelect.svelte.ts` compares each state with the previous one it saw (never
   with nothing: the first state sets the baseline and opens nothing) and, when
   `keyboardParts[i].selected` goes from false to true for an `i` other than `ui.selectedPart`,
   runs the part opener on `i` from whatever page is showing (Library and Settings included: the
   gesture is deliberate), whatever the source (hardware, F1–F4, `selectPart` from the screen);
   a state that leaves `selected` as it was opens nothing (CH-D15). Real-time safety: the
   counter is a plain field the engine thread already publishes with `surface`; no allocation.

Nothing else is new on the wire: every command the page sends exists (`setPartVolume`,
`setPartPan`, `togglePart`, `setPartSolo`, `setStripSend`, `addSend`, `setStripEq`,
`setStripTone`, `setStripCompressorOn` / `Preset` / `Param`, `setStripInsertKind` / `On` /
`Setting`, `toggleRotaryFast`, `setStripMono`, `setStripPortamento`, `setPartOctave`,
`setBendRange`, `selectPart`), as do every state field read and the shell's plugin editor call.
The band's and key row's commands are the kit's.

## Checks

Vitest (`npx vitest run` on the page and component tests), each against the board fixture
(`boardState` and `boardUi`) unless it says otherwise, reading roles, accessible names,
attributes (`data-face`, `data-hue`, `data-run`, `data-overflow`), the commands sent (a fake
`send`) and the shell call (a fake `pluginEditor`); never computed colours or layout. "Reads
X" for a bar readout means its `aria-valuetext` is X; for anything with an `aria-label` "is
named X" means its accessible name; "reads X" for anything else means the `textContent` of the
one span that holds that text (a readout's label and value, a value and its unit, a kind name
and its ▼, "CPU" and its number are separate spans, and the markup puts no whitespace between
spans in a row: "the readouts read" quotes label and value joined by one space for brevity,
tested as the two spans).

1. Parts list: twelve entries in the order R1, R2, R3, L, Rhythm 1 … Phrase 2; entry 1 has
   `aria-current="true"`, `data-face="chosen"`, its tag `data-hue="r1"`, and is named "Part 1 of
   12: R1 Stage Grand, open"; entry 3 is named "Part 3 of 12: R3 Brass Section, off" and its tag
   has `data-hue="d"`; a Style entry shows its tag and no name; the header's count span reads "1
   of 12";
   clicking entry 2 sets `ui.selectedPart` to 1 and sends `selectPart {part: 1}`; clicking Rhythm
   1 sets 4 and sends nothing; ▶ on part 0 does what clicking entry 2 does.
2. Part header: the block reads "Right 1" with `data-hue="r1"`; the sound button's name is the
   Stage template's example for Stage Grand ("Right 1 sound: 1 Stage Grand. Opens the quick
   sound list"); "Mine" is shown; the plugin line's spans read "Sampler Deluxe · ", "playing",
   " · " and "in process", and the status span has `data-hue="ok"`; Edit calls `pluginEditor(0, true)`; the CPU number reads
   "3" (with `meters.channels` empty, "—" with `data-hue="d"`); ▶ is named
   "Next part (R2)" and opens part 1; ◀ "Previous part (Phrase 2)" opens 11. With `plugin`
   removed: no plugin line and no Edit. With `plugin.status` "failed", `missing` true: the
   status span reads "missing" with `data-hue="warn"`, and there is no process span.
3. Compact block: the chord's runs are "Am" and "7", the tones "A C E G", "104" and "BPM", the
   run dot `data-run="running"` with `aria-label="Running"`, "Main B" `data-hue="main"`; stopped:
   `data-run="stopped"` and no label, the section `data-hue="m"`; sync start: `data-run="sync"`,
   `aria-label="Sync start"`. Its `aria-label` is the template's example; with `chord.name` null
   it contains "no chord" and the tones are empty.
4. Bar maths (pure: `fraction` and `fillBox` in `app/src/ui/BarReadout/bar.ts`, part of
   Components row 8; `hzUnit`, `ratioText` and `dbText` in `app/src/ui/BarReadout/eq.ts`, Gap
   against today): `fraction({ value, min, max, steps? })`
   is `(value − min) / (max − min)`, or with `steps` (a Hz table) `stepOf(steps, value) /
   (steps.length − 1)`; it gives the fixture's fractions for each row of the Groups tables
   (Level 90 → 0.709, Pan 64 → 0.504, Low +2 → 0.583, Low freq 120 → 12 / 36, High freq 8000 →
   24 / 30, Threshold −18 → 0.625, Ratio 30 → 0.105, Release 120 → 0.111, Cutoff 76 → 0.598,
   Portamento 0 → 0); `fillBox(f, bipolar)` gives `{fl, fw}`
   (0.709 → {0, 71}; 0.583 bipolar → {50, 8}; 0.3 bipolar → {30, 20}); `hzUnit(120)` is ["120",
   "Hz"], `hzUnit(8000)` ["8.0", "kHz"], `hzUnit(1200)` ["1.2", "kHz"]; `ratioText(30)` "3",
   `ratioText(25)` "2.5"; `dbText(−18)` "−18".
5. BarReadout as a control: Level has `role="slider"`, `aria-valuenow` 90, `aria-valuetext`
   "Level 90"; a 20px rightward drag from any point sends `setPartVolume {part: 0, volume: 100}`
   (fake frames) and nothing more on pointerup (the value didn't change after the frame's
   send); a press and release without movement sends nothing; with Shift held, 20px sends 92
   (one unit per 8px; `shiftKey` on the pointer events); wheel up sends 91; ArrowRight and ArrowUp 91, ArrowDown 89, PageUp 100,
   End 127; double-click sends 100; with `waiting` true it reads "Level 90, hardware fader away".
   Low freq at 120 Hz: ArrowRight sends `setStripEq` with `lowFreq` 140 (120's nearest step is
   125; the step after it is 140), ArrowLeft sends 110. Pan reads "Pan C" and a double-click
   sends `setPartPan {pan: 64}`. Send 5 is `aria-disabled`, reads "Send 5, not added" and sends
   nothing on drag, wheel or keys.
6. Sends: rows read "Send 1, reverb, 40", "Send 2, chorus, 12", "Send 3, delay, 0", "Send 4,
   phaser, 20", "Send 5, not added", "Send 6, not added"; dragging Phaser sends `setStripSend
   {strip: 0, send: 3, level}`; + Add send is named "Add a send effect (5 of 6)", opens a listbox
   of twelve options with focus on the listbox and its `aria-activedescendant` on Hall, and
   choosing "Plate" sends `addSend {kind: 'plate'}` and closes it; with six sends the button is
   `aria-disabled`.
7. Lamps: On reads "On" and is named "Right 1 on", `data-face="on"`, click sends `togglePart
   {part: 0}`, a 350 ms press sends `setLayer {swap, part 0}` and no toggle (fake timers); Solo
   `data-face="off"`, click sends
   `setPartSolo {part: 0}`; with `mixer.partSolo` 0 it is lit and a click sends `setPartSolo {part:
   null}`; Compressor On lit, click sends `setStripCompressorOn {strip: 0, on: false}`; Rotary
   fast lit, click sends `toggleRotaryFast`; Insert 1 On lit, click sends `setStripInsertOn {strip:
   0, slot: 0, on: false}`; Mono off, click sends `setStripMono {strip: 0, on: true}`.
8. EQ and Tone: rows read "Low +2 dB", "Low freq 120 Hz", "High −2 dB", "High freq 8.0 kHz";
   "Cutoff +12", "Resonance +4", "Attack 0", "Release +8", "Vibrato 0"; a drag on Cutoff sends
   `setStripTone {strip: 0, control: 'cutoff', value}`; double-click on Cutoff sends 64; More
   is `aria-expanded="false"` and the rows Vib rate and Vib delay are absent; after a click they
   are present (reading "Vib rate 0", "Vib delay 0"), the button reads "‹ Less" and is named
   "Fewer tone settings", and the group carries `data-overflow="true"`.
9. Compressor: "Edited" is shown; the Punchy tab has `aria-selected="true"` and
   `data-face="chosen"`; clicking Rich sends `setStripCompressorPreset {strip: 0, preset: 'rich'}`;
   rows read "Threshold −18 dB", "Ratio 3:1", "Attack 10 ms", "Release 120 ms", "Make-up 0
   dB"; a drag on Ratio sends `setStripCompressorParam {param: 'ratio'}`; double-click on
   Threshold sends −24 and on Make-up sends 0 although it is 0 already (Punchy's; a reset
   always sends); the Punchy tab is the only tab with `tabindex`
   0, ArrowRight moves focus to Electronic without sending, Enter there sends the preset; a click
   on Punchy sends `setStripCompressorPreset {preset: 'punchy'}`; with `edited` false, no
   "Edited".
10. Inserts: slot 1's kind button is named "Insert 1 kind: Rotary. Choose None, Distortion,
    Compressor, Auto Wah, Tremolo, Rotary or Phaser", opens a listbox of seven with Rotary
    `aria-selected`, and choosing Phaser sends `setStripInsertKind {strip: 0, slot: 0, kind:
    'phaser'}`; choosing Rotary (the current kind) closes it and sends nothing; Esc closes it
    without sending and focus returns to the button; the options carry `data-tip`; the rows read
    "Depth 64", "Drive 20", "Balance 64"; a drag on Drive sends `setStripInsertSetting {slot: 0,
    setting: 1}`; slot 2's kind button's name span reads "None" and it is named "Insert 2 kind: None. Choose
    None, Distortion, Compressor, Auto Wah, Tremolo, Rotary or Phaser"; slot 2 has no On lamp and
    no rows; with slot 2 set to a distortion (three settings), its On lamp (named "Insert 2 off")
    and three rows appear; with a phaser there, the Rate row reads "Rate 0.50 Hz" and its unit
    span is "Hz".
11. Play: Portamento `aria-valuetext` "Portamento time 0, off"; ArrowRight sends
    `setStripPortamento {strip: 0, on: true, time: 1}`; at time 1, ArrowLeft sends `{on: false,
    time: 0}`; with `portamento` `{on: false, time: 40}` it reads "Portamento time 40, off" and
    double-click sends `{on: false, time: 0}`; Octave's value reads "0" and is named "Octave 0"
    (at octave 1: "+1", "Octave +1"), − sends `setPartOctave {part: 0, octave: −1}`, at −2 − is
    `aria-disabled`; Bend's value reads "2" and is named "Bend range 2 semitones", + sends
    `setBendRange {part: 0, semitones: 3}`, at 12 + is `aria-disabled`.
12. Style part open (`ui.selectedPart` 4, until #518): the block reads "Rhythm 1" with
    `data-hue="t2"`; Level sends `setStylePartVolume {part: 0, volume}`; Pan, the Tone rows and
    the Play rows are `aria-disabled`; the sound reads `voice.label`; no Mine, plugin line or Edit;
    On sends `toggleStylePart {part: 0}`; Solo sends `setStyleSolo {part: 0}`; with
    `styleParts[0].strip.inserts[0]` a distortion on, slot 1's kind name span reads "Distortion",
    its On lamp is named "Insert 1 on" and a click sends `setStripInsertOn {strip: 4, slot: 0,
    on: false}`, and a drag on its Drive row sends `setStripInsertSetting {strip: 4, slot: 0,
    setting: 0}`.
13. Half band: nine strips with the kit's names; strip 1's `aria-valuetext` "Right 1 90"; a 20px
    upward drag on strip 1 sends its `set` with `volume` 148 clamped to 127 (20 × 127 / 44 = 58
    → 90 + 58 = 148 → 127); strip 2 shows "↕"; the Reverb tab sends `setFaderLayer {layer:
    'reverb'}`; the lamp row's nine buttons as Stage check 11; Track ◀ ▶ as Stage check 14; knob
    1's `aria-valuetext` "Dynamics 127", ▲ disabled on page 1; pad 10 `data-face="solid"`, pad 11
    `data-face="waiting"`, pads 3 and 7 Absent, pad 4's caption reads "Sync start" and it is
    named "Sync start (pad 4)" (the kit's "{caption} (pad n)" with the half caption), pad 16's
    "Start"; the pads header's spans read "Sections", " · " and "next Main C", and
    "next Main C" has `data-hue="main"`; Start / Stop (▶) has `aria-pressed="true"` and sends
    `startStop`; Style tempo sends `resetTempo`; Fill ▲ sends `fillUp`.
14. Key row: the status line is empty and nothing in it is focusable; the readouts read "Split
    F#2", "Detect lower", "Left G A C E" (`data-hue="l"`), "Right E4 A4" (`data-hue="r1"`); the
    size button reads "61 keys", is named "Keyboard size 61 keys. Click for 88", and a click
    calls `setKeyRange(88)`; at 88 a click calls `setKeyRange(49)`; with `keyboard.detection`
    [55, 127] it reads "Detect upper", with [0, 127] "Detect full"; with no held keys "Left —"
    and "Right —" (`data-hue="d"`); with `chord.name` "Bb" and held 46 (zone left) the Left reads
    "Bb"; with no chord and held 46 it reads "A#"; with 36 and 48 held (both C) it reads "C";
    with a message, the line shows it and the readouts stay.
15. App bar, page variant: the rack readout's spans read "Rack", "A1" and "Sunday drive", the
    modified dot (`data-face="on"`, the Stage's StatusDot hook) is present, and its name "Rack: Sunday drive, modified, on Quick Rack A1. Opens the Rack page"; it opens the
    Rack page's interim target; One Touch 2 is chosen; the Channel tab has `aria-current="page"`;
    the Stage tab sets `ui.page` to `stage`.
16. Opening (`partSelect.svelte.ts`): after a first state (part 0 selected) nothing opens; a
    second state whose `keyboardParts[2].selected` turns true opens Channel for part 2 (`ui.page`
    `channel`, `ui.selectedPart` 2) from `ui.page` `stage` and from `library` alike; a state that
    leaves `selected` where it was does not; Esc on the Channel page with nothing open sets
    `ui.page` to `stage`.
17. Every interactive element has a `data-tip` in the catalog (the existing coverage test, with
    the Channel page and an open kind menu in its `STATES`), and no element carries
    `mixer.channel.close` or `mixer.channel.portamento_time`.
18. Column overflow (pure, `columnHeight(parts: ColumnPart[])` in
    `app/src/ui/BarReadout/overflow.ts`, where `ColumnPart` is `'header'` (24), `'sendsHeader'`
    (32), `'row'` (32), `'tabs'` (56), `'note'` (36) or `{ gap: number }`): the board's
    columns give 356, 380, 344 and 368; with insert 2 a four-setting kind, column D gives 500 and
    the group carries `data-overflow="true"`; with Tone More, column B gives 444; on the board no
    group has the attribute at all.

**Story and screenshot checks** (`npm run shots -- Channel`, real Chrome):

- `Pages/Channel` › `Board` (export `Board`, layout `fullscreen`, `parameters.shots = {
  viewport: { width: 1440, height: 900 }, mask: ['[data-shot-mask="when"]'] }`) renders `Channel`
  with `boardState`, `boardUi`, `boardNow`, `boardMeterHolds` and `menu` null (the props above),
  unscaled, in both themes, against
  `app/src/ui/Channel/crops/Board-dark.png` and `Board-light.png` (copies of
  `docs/design/push/png/Channel-Dark.png` and `Channel-Light.png`, 1440 × 900): at most 0.02 of
  the unmasked pixels differ. This needs the Stage lane's `shots.ts` item.
- The same story covers what vitest can't: the compact chord's glow and two weights, the bar
  fills and caps, the half-band meter heights, cap and ghost positions, the 32px knob arcs and tip
  dots, the pad bars.
- `Primitives/BarReadout` › `Rows` (the fixture's Level, Pan, Low, Low freq, Threshold, Send 5): one
  of each shape, unipolar, bipolar, disabled; crop `Channel 417,200 225.75×64` for Level and Pan.
- `Primitives/KindMenu` › `Open` (insert 1's menu open on Rotary): the list, the selected row and
  the cursor row; no crop (the board draws it closed), judged by Inspect.
- `Components/PartsList` › `LongName` (R2, index 1, with the sound "A Very Long Sound Name For
  Testing"): the name ends in an ellipsis inside its 152px cell.
- `Components/CompactNowPlaying` › `LongChord` (`"C#m7b5/G#"`, tones "C# E G B"): the chord
  keeps 48px, the tones end in an ellipsis, "Main B" stays at the right; no crop.
- `Components/InsertsPlayGroup` › `TwoInserts` (slot 2 a distortion): the column scrolls
  (`data-overflow`), the Play group reachable by scrolling; no crop.
- axe finds no violation on any story.

## Decisions

- **CH-D1 · Tall page frame.** Channel is the first tall page: app bar (page variant), section
  row, a 468px page, the half band, the key row with its status line. Every display tab but the
  Stage uses this frame (Effects, Quick Racks, Multi Pads, Looper, Harm/Arp, #502 and on), so it
  is specified once, in Kit additions here, and their specs name it. This supersedes Stage D2's
  "the display tabs replace only the display" and kit › Full band's "on display pages (Stage
  and the display tabs)": the full band is the Stage's alone (DECISIONS H1); Stage.md and
  kit.md say so when next edited (Follow-ups).
- **CH-D2 · Compact block fit.** The chord never shrinks (48px fixed) and the section always
  shows whole; the tones give way first (ellipsis, down to nothing), then the chord is clipped at
  its right edge. A long chord with its tones is rarer than a long chord alone, and the tones are
  repeated in the key row.
- **CH-D3 · Style parts in the list.** A Style part's entry shows its tag only (no voice name),
  as the board draws: the voice is the style's, and the entry is a destination, not a readout.
  The Style part page (#518) shows the voice.
- **CH-D4 · No close.** The Channel is a page with a tab, so it has no × and no close command;
  the Stage tab, Alt+G and Esc (once nothing is open over the page) leave it.
  `mixer.channel.close` is dropped (CH-C1).
- **CH-D5 · Overflow.** The groups grid is 380 tall and the board fills column B exactly (A
  356, C 344, D 368). More rows (Tone's More, a second insert with settings) push past it; rather
  than hide settings or add a popover, the column scrolls (`overflow-y: auto; scrollbar-width:
  thin`). The board never scrolls. Tone's More toggles the two vibrato rows in place.
- **CH-D6 · Bar readout gesture.** Horizontal, relative, one unit per 2px (Shift 8px), sends at
  most once per frame and once more on release only when the value moved since the last send,
  double-click resets to the row's default; the kit's fader rules (Stage D23) turned sideways,
  with the no-change release sending nothing so a click never re-sends. The bar is about 72px
  wide, so the gesture doesn't map the track to the range (that would be 1.8 units per px).
- **CH-D7 · Send labels.** Sends 1–3 read "Reverb", "Chorus", "Delay" (the buses, what the fader
  layers and the Launchkey call them), never the bus's type name; sends 4–6 read their kind's
  name ("Phaser", "Plate", "Delay 1/8.").
- **CH-D8 · Frequency rows.** The value shows the state's Hz as it is (an OTS or rack may set a
  frequency between two XG steps), the bar sits at the nearest step, and a drag or key moves by
  steps of the XG table from that step. Below 1000 Hz "120 Hz", above "8.0 kHz".
- **CH-D9 · Vibrato row.** Vibrato is the depth, bipolar around 64 like every tone offset; the
  board's unipolar bar was a drawing shortcut. Rate and Delay are behind More.
- **CH-D10 · Compressor off.** The rows keep their look and still edit when the compressor is
  off (the board draws no off look, and dimming would suggest they are disabled).
- **CH-D11 · Insert settings.** Every insert setting is a unipolar bar from `min` to `max`,
  reading the state's `display` string, whatever its name; the board's centred "Balance 0" was
  invented (Balance 64 reads "64").
- **CH-D12 · Portamento.** One control, the time bar: dragging above 0 sends `on: true` with the
  time, 0 sends `on: false`. A switch with time 0 means no glide, so the two states collapse
  without loss; the board draws no switch.
- **CH-D13 · Kind menu.** The insert kind and + Add send open a small listbox (not a native
  `<select>`, which can't be drawn to the board and isn't themed). It is the one place with a
  hover look (the cursor row in `--line`), because a menu needs one.
- **CH-D14 · Style part until #518.** The same page with the Style strip, Pan, Tone and Play
  disabled and the Style commands for level, on and solo; #518 replaces this row.
- **CH-D15 · Hardware part select opens Channel.** The board's new rule (Shift + fader button
  1–4 opens Channel) is honoured; until CH-C2 the trigger is any `selected` change to a new part,
  so F1–F4 open it too, which fits the parity rule (the screen's part select and the hardware's
  are the same gesture).
- **CH-D16 · CPU readout.** The channel meter's `cpu` (SoundFont or plugin alike), rounded to a
  whole percent; "—" without a synth. The plugin's own `cpu` is a share of a core, not of the
  buffer, so it isn't shown here.
- **CH-D17 · Mine.** "Mine" shows when the sound is one of the user's library sounds
  (`saved:<id>`, or a preset id that `inMySounds` finds there), the same rule as Library ›
  Sounds' Mine filter.
- **CH-D18 · Plugin line words.** `status` as the state's word (loading, playing, failed,
  muted), coloured `--m`, `--ok`, `--ending`, `--warn`; "in process" when the plugin runs inside
  yahaha (`outOfProcess` false), with ⚠ only when that was a fallback; "missing" in `--warn`.
- **CH-D19 · Key readouts.** The key row's status line carries the key strip's readouts on the
  right (Split, Detect, Left, Right, size) because the Stage's cheek is gone (Stage D25) and the
  tall pages have the 20px. Left-hand notes are pitch-class names (the chord), right-hand notes
  carry their octave (Yamaha numbering, C3 = 60), both spelled by the chord's rule (Stage D20)
  and with sharps when there is no chord; the Split and a Detect range use the key strip's
  `noteName` (`app/src/panels/keystrip/keyboard.ts`, the same names as the key labels). The
  size button cycles 49 → 61 → 88 → 49 (`ui.setKeyRange`); matching the Launchkey again is
  Settings › Keyboard's (#530).
- **CH-D20 · Half-band gestures.** The half strips keep the full strips' relative drag, with
  44px of travel (`127 / 44` units per px), so a flick still sweeps; fine control is the full
  band on the Stage or the bar readouts here.
- **CH-D21 · Pad captions at half size.** The half pads keep the Stage's sixteen captions in
  sentence case with the ▸ and ■ shapes ("Sync start ▸", "Sync stop ■", "Auto fill", "Start"),
  the board's, since 12px in 28px leaves no room for "Start / Stop".
- **CH-D22 · Build order.** The Channel lane builds after the Stage lane and reuses its
  components and `Stage.fixtures.ts` as they land; it adds sizes and variants to them (the
  Components table) and extracts the shared clock module from `StageWiring.svelte` in its own
  PR, never a second copy. If the order has to flip,
  the orchestrator moves those files into a contract PR first.
- **CH-D23 · Style part inserts live here.** With a Style part open, the Inserts group edits
  that part's style insertion effect (slot 1) and its own second slot through the strip commands,
  so `setPartInsertOn` and `setPartInsertAmount` (which the strip commands map onto) have their
  app control on this page from the Channel build on, as the Effects spec's FX-D12 assumes; the
  Style part spec (#518) keeps the group, and the Effects drawer's Inserts card can go when
  Channel lands. Rotary fast stays in the group's header for every part because it is global.

## Follow-ups

- #518 Channel-StylePart: the Style part page (CH-D14 is the interim).
- `docs/app-api.md` › "Strip compressor types": the make-up column says +3…+9 dB; the engine
  (`part_comp.rs` `preset_params`) and `defaultStrip()` have 0 dB on every type. A one-line docs
  fix in the contract (the orchestrator's; `api_doc_check` doesn't read that table).
- A gain-reduction meter for the strip compressor would need it in `meters` (DECISIONS M8).
- Removing an added send from this page (today only on Effects, #502).
- A send row for the Multi Pads or the band send scales (Effects, #502).
- Per-part Launchkey mappings for the EQ, compressor and tone rows exist only through the rack's
  controller map (Rack-MapEdit, #517); a direct "learn" from a row is not drawn.
- CH-C2's `surface.partSelectSeq`, if the owner prefers F1–F4 not to open Channel.
- A fit rule for the compact chord beyond CH-D2 if long chords prove common.
- Stage.md D2 and kit › Full band still say the display tabs keep the full band; CH-D1 has
  them on the half band. A one-line fix in each when next edited (the Stage lane's files).
- Stage D46 keeps the clock in `StageWiring.svelte`; the Channel build extracts
  `app/src/pages/clock.svelte.ts` for both. If the Stage lane prefers to extract it first, its
  spec names the module.

## Kit additions

The parts kit.md says this spec owns ("Variants owned elsewhere"). They move into kit.md
verbatim when it is next edited; until then every tall page spec reads them here. Geometry at
1440 × 900; tokens, faces and conventions are the kit's.

### App bar, page variant

`24,24 1392×36`, the kit's app bar with two readouts after the wordmark, because the page
replaces the display that carries them on the Stage (every non-Stage page: Channel, Effects,
Quick Racks, Multi Pads, Looper, Harm/Arp, Library, Settings):

- **Rack readout**, 16px after the wordmark (`margin-left: 8px` in the bar's gap-8 row): the
  Stage's RackReadout (Stage › Sounds row) on one line: a text button 32 tall, `flex: 0 1 auto;
  min-width: 0`, items on the baseline, gap 6, 14 / 400: "Rack" `--m`, the slot `--t` ("A1"; no
  loaded button: nothing, Stage D21), the name `--t` (`liveRack.name`, `min-width: 0`, no wrap,
  ellipsis), then (centred) the 5px `--t` modified dot when `liveRack.modified`. Click opens the
  Rack page (Stage D32 interim: the Rack drawer). Tooltip `stage.rack_name`. `aria-label` as the
  Stage's ("Rack: Sunday drive, modified, on Quick Rack A1. Opens the Rack page").
- **One Touch**, 12px after (`margin-left: 4px` plus the gap), `flex: none`: the Stage's OneTouch
  group (Stage › Style line: "One Touch" 14 `--m` with 4px right margin, four 32 × 32 buttons,
  chosen = `ots.applied`, `recallOts { index }`, tooltips `ots.1`–`ots.4`, Stage D16, D17).
- Then the page tabs (`margin-left: auto`, `flex: none`), the right area (196 wide, `flex:
  none`: separator, Launchkey status, health slot), all as kit › App bar. The rack readout is the
  only item that shrinks, so the tabs sit at the same x on every board whatever the rack name;
  the wordmark, One Touch, tabs and right area take about 1160px, leaving the readout at least
  200px.

### Compact now-playing block

`320 × 84`, drawn at `48,128` on the Channel; specified in full under Page › Compact block above
(the style name block, tempo, run dot, the 48px chord with its tones, the playing section). Any
tall page that keeps a now-playing block uses it unchanged at its own x, y.

### Half band

`24,600 1392×176` on tall pages, margin-top 20 under the page; four sections side by side, gap
12: **Faders** `24,600 614×176`, **Track** `650,600 40×176`, **Knobs and pads** `702,600 614×176`,
**Transport** `1328,600 88×176`. Each starts with the kit's hairline header row (36 tall). The
faders are 40px narrower than the full band's and the Track ◀ ▶ take that width (DECISIONS H2:
Track sits between the faders and the knobs; no on-screen Shift button, since every Shift
function has its own control). Everything reads and sends as the full band (kit › Full band);
below is the geometry and what differs.

#### Faders (half)

Header row, gap 12, as kit › Faders (the layer tabs' padding is `11px 8px 0` here). Below (8px),
`24,644 614×132`, a column:

- **Strips** (84 tall): `repeat(9, minmax(0, 1fr))`, gap 8 (61.1px each), each a column: the
  **fader** (a 66-tall button, `position: relative`, full width) over the **name button** (18
  tall, 12 / 500 in the hue, centred, gap 4, the kit's marks with the ⚠ and ✕ at 11px and the
  edited dot 4px).
  - **Value**: top 0, 16 tall, centred, 15 / 300, in the hue (the kit's formats by layer).
  - **Track**: from 19 to 63 (`TOP` 19, travel 44). Two 6px meter bars at `50% − 11px` and
    `50% − 3px`, top 19 bottom 3, on `--mbg` (hidden, `opacity: 0`, when unused or layered): the
    peak and the RMS, each `height44(x) = round(44 × clamp((20·log10(x) + 60) / 60, 0, 1))` px from
    the bottom (3px up), in the hue at `--meter-mix`. A 14 × 1 `--peak` tick at the held peak,
    left `50% − 11px`, bottom `3 + height44(hold)`.
  - **Set level**: a 3px `--track` groove at `50% + 6px` from 19 to 63; the 3px fill from the
    bottom, `44 − capTop` tall, in the hue, glow `0 0 6px` at `--fill-glow-mix`; an 8 × 2 cap at
    `50% + 1px`, top `capTop + 18`, where `capTop = round((1 − value / 127) × 44)`. Unused: no
    fill, no cap, the kit's dashed groove (`repeating-linear-gradient(to bottom, var(--line) 0
    3px, transparent 3px 7px)`). Part off: fill and cap at 35% of the hue, value and name `--d`.
  - **Soft takeover**: "↕" 12px `--m` at the top-left (top 0, left 0); a 30 × 0 dashed 1px `--m`
    line at `50% − 15px`, top `round((1 − position / 127) × 44) + 19`.
  - **Layers**: as the kit (strips 1–4 lose their meters, fill and cap go `--t`, the value reads
    "Rev 40").
  - **As a control**: as kit › FaderStrip with `--travel` 44: `value = clamp(round(v0 + (y0 − y)
    × 127 / 44), 0, 127)` (CH-D20); wheel, keys, double-click, tooltips and `aria` as the kit's.
- **Lamp row** (LampRow `size half`, Components row 28a): the headers 14 tall (not the kit's
  18; `repeat(9, 1fr)`, column gap 8, 12px line-height 12 `--m`, bottom hairline): "Part
  on/off" over 1–4, "Functions" over 5–9 with "Launchkey fader buttons 5–9" right-aligned;
  then the row (32 tall, 2px below, gap 8, the 1px `--line` divider between columns 4 and 5 at
  `left: calc((100% − 64px) × 4 / 9 + 28px)`): the kit's nine buttons (kit › Lamp row; the master
  button reads "Panel" / "Style") as LampButton `size half` (the `cell` size with a 12px label,
  Components row 1) and the master button a Button `half` (the column's full width, 32 tall,
  12px centred, padding 0 4; Components row 2).

#### Track

`650,600 40×176`: header "Track" (36 tall, hairline); then (8px) ◀ and ▶, 40 × 32 off-face
buttons, 12px, gap 8, a column. They are the Stage's style-line ◀ ▶ (Stage › Style line:
`surface.controls[trackPrev / trackNext]`, `shiftAction` with `ui.shift`, disabled when null or
no neighbour, D38); tooltips `style.prev`, `style.next`; `aria-label`s "Previous style (Track
left)", "Next style (Track right)".

#### Knobs and pads (half)

`702,600 614×176`. One header row for both (36 tall, hairline, items centred, gap 8, no wrap):
"Knobs" 14 `--m`; the page as the kit's accent block (`knobs.pageName`; swap mode: on the part's
hue); ▲ ▼ as 28 × 28 off-face buttons, 11px (`stepKnobPage`, disabled at the ends, tooltip
`knobs.page`); "Page" 13 `--m` and `{pageNumber}/{pageCount}` `--t`; then `margin-left: auto`:
"Pads" 14 `--m`; `pads.pageName` 14 `--t` followed, on Sections with a next section, by " · "
in `--t` and then "next {next}" in the next section's hue (its Genos name; the count row's next;
none: the page name alone; other pages: the page name alone); ▲ ▼ 28 × 28, 11px (`surface.controls[padBankUp /
padBankDown].action`, tooltips `padpage.prev`, `padpage.next`); "Bank" 13 `--m` and
`{pads.pageNumber}/{pads.pageCount}` `--t`. No legend.

- **Knobs** (8px below, 48 tall): `repeat(8, minmax(0, 1fr))`, column gap 6 (71.5px each); each a
  button column, centred: the **ring** 32px (`conic-gradient(from 225deg, var(--a) 0 <deg>,
  var(--ring-rest) <deg> 270deg, transparent 270deg)`, `deg = round(fraction × 270)` with the
  kit's `fraction`; a `--g` disc inset 2px holding the **value** 12 / 300 `--a`, no wrap, the "%"
  kept in the number here); a 4px `--a` **tip dot** whose centre is at radius 15 from the ring's
  centre, angle `225° + deg` clockwise from up (left `16 + 15·sin θ − 2`, top `16 − 15·cos θ −
  2`); then (2px below) the **legend** 14 tall, 12 `--t2`: the knob's plain name (Stage D6).
  No Assign: ring and rest `--mbg`, no dot, empty value, legend "---" in `--d` (the kit's), `aria-disabled`. No
  code line. As a control: as kit › Knob (drag per 4px, wheel, double-click `resetKnob`, arrows;

#### Transport (half)

`1328,600 88×176`: header "Transport" (36 tall, hairline); then (8px) a grid `40px 40px`, rows
24, gap `3px 8px`, five rows: **▶** | **■**, **Reset** | **Fade**, **Fill ▲** | **Fill ▼**,
**+** | **−**, **Style tempo** (spanning both columns). All off-face, 24 tall, label centred:

| Button | Face | Sends | Tooltip |
|---|---|---|---|
| ▶ (Start / Stop) | 12px `--t`, padding-bottom 3; `aria-pressed` always present, "true" while `transport.running`, "false" otherwise (the full band's Start / Stop has none; the half one is a toggle button because its bar is the only running cue); running: a 2px `--ok` bar at bottom 3, left and right 8, radius 1, `--bg` glow | `startStop` | `transport.start_stop` |
| ■ (Stop) | 12px `--t2` | `stop` | `transport.stop` |
| Reset | 11px | `sectionReset` | `transport.section_reset` |
| Fade | 11px; faces as kit (armed waiting, fading on) | `toggleFade` | `transport.fade` |
| Fill ▲ / Fill ▼ | 11px, the arrow 8px; a `role="group"` "Fills" | `fillUp` / `fillDown` | `transport.fill_up`, `transport.fill_down` |
| + / − (Tempo) | 14 / 300 | `tempoUp` / `tempoDown`, repeating while held (`tempoHold`) | `tempo.up`, `tempo.down` |
| Style tempo | 11px | `resetTempo` | `tempo.reset` |

`aria-label`s: "Start / Stop{, running} (Play). The same control as pad 16", "Stop", "Section
reset", "Fade in/out", "Fill up", "Fill down", "Tempo up", "Tempo down", "Style tempo".
Launchkey as kit › Transport and tempo.

### Key row

`24,796 1392×80` on tall pages (margin-top 20 under the half band), a column: the **status
line** (20 tall), 4px, the **key strip** (56 tall, kit › Key strip, unchanged).

The status line is one row, 20 tall, items centred, gap 16, no wrap: the kit's status line
(`role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`, `flex: 1`, `min-width: 0`, ellipsis; `state.message`
only, never coaching, the clear button as kit › Status line) and then, right-aligned, the **key
readouts** in a row with gap 16, each a label span 13 / 400 `--m` and, 4px after it
(`margin-left: 4px`), its value span 13 / 400 `--t`:

| Readout | Reads | Value |
|---|---|---|
| "Split {key}" | `keyboard.leftSplit` | `noteName(split)` ("F#2"; C3 = 60) |
| "Detect {where}" | `keyboard.detection` | "lower" when it is `[0, leftSplit]`, "upper" when `[leftSplit + 1, 127]`, "full" when `[0, 127]`, else "{noteName(lo)}–{noteName(hi)}" |
| "Left {notes}" | `keyboard.held` with `zone` left, low to high | pitch-class names, each once, in order of first appearance ("G A C E"; C2 and C3 held give one "C"), space-separated, in `--l` (`data-hue="l"`); none: "—" in `--d` (`data-hue="d"`) |
| "Right {notes}" | `keyboard.held` with `zone` right, low to high | names with octave ("E4 A4"), in the hue of the first part in the lowest right note's `parts` (`--r1`…; that note has no parts: `--t`); none: "—" in `--d` |
| "{n} keys" | `ui.keyRange`, else the Launchkey's range (kit › Key strip) | a text button, 13 `--t`: click cycles 49 → 61 → 88 → 49 (`ui.setKeyRange`); tooltip `keystrip.range`; `aria-label` "Keyboard size {n} keys. Click for {next}" |

The four readouts are not controls; each carries tooltip `keystrip.readout` (new, CH-C1).
The Left and Right names are spelled by the chord's rule (Stage D20: flats when the chord's
root is written with `b` or is F, else sharps), and with sharps when there is no chord
(CH-D19). The key strip's own `aria-label` stays as the kit's.

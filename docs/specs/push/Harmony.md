# Harmony

The Harm/Arp display page: the Keyboard Harmony / Arpeggio switch, the type, and the settings
the type has, with the compact now-playing block beside it. The band and the keys stay below it,
so the player sets up the harmony without leaving the band.

- **Issue:** #505 · **Flow:** Pads, loops, harmony · **Boards:**
  `docs/design/push/Harmony-Dark.dc.html`, `Harmony-Light.dc.html`; pictures
  `docs/design/push/png/Harmony-Dark.png`, `Harmony-Light.png` (1440 × 900). The spec stands
  without them: every value a builder needs is below, in [kit.md](kit.md) or in
  [Stage.md](Stage.md); the board lines in the Components table are for cutting crops.
- **Built from:** [kit.md](kit.md): App bar (the page variant, in Kit additions below), Section
  row, Full band, Key strip, Status line, the faces and tokens; and the compact now-playing
  block (Kit additions). This file specifies the page's own right column: the header, the
  category tabs, the type grid and the settings column.
- **Copied from:** Stage (#500). The section row, band, status line and keys are the Stage's,
  unchanged; this page replaces only the display (`24,112 1392×300`). One band difference: the
  Harm/Arp lamp (fader button 5) is lit, because `harmonyArp.on` is true on the board.
- **Variants of this screen** (they spec only what differs): Harmony-Arp (#527): an arpeggio
  pattern selected, with the arpeggio's settings. The settings column below is a `kind` switch
  so that spec adds the `arpeggio` kind without touching the others (HA-D15).
- **Glance order** (what must read first, brightest to quietest): the chosen type (the white
  block in the grid) and the On lamp, then the chord (48px, accent), then the type name in the
  header. The page's only glows are the chord's `--ba`, the two `--bg` status dots (the
  compact block's run dot, the app bar's Launchkey dot) and the kit's band glows.
- **Before building:** the Stage lane (#500) must have landed: it builds the kit components
  this page reuses (AppBar, SectionRow, FullBand, StatusLine, KeyStrip, ChosenTabs, LampButton,
  Stage.md Components 2–4), `ui.page` (Stage.md D2), the page-wiring pattern (D46),
  `app/src/ui/Stage/Stage.fixtures.ts` and the shots masks (D39). This lane then adds to the
  Stage's components the sizes and variants it needs, and whatever LampButton still lacks
  (controlled `on`, `data-face`, `tip`): the list is under Components › Files this page owns.
  Tooltips on components: a Svelte action can't go on a component, so each kit component that
  is a control takes a `tip` prop (the key) and puts `use:tip` on its own element; the Stage
  lane adds it where it builds the component (Stage.md Check 15 needs it too), this lane
  where it doesn't, and this page's new components take the same prop. Then Stage C5
  (tooltips) and this page's C-HA1 (two tooltip keys) must land; the rest doesn't block (see
  Contract changes needed).

## Layout

At 1440 × 900, laid out like the Stage (Stage.md D1: the app shell scales it, the component
never does). Padding 24 all round; a column.

| Region | Box | What's in it | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| App bar | `24,24 1392×36` | wordmark, rack readout, One Touch 1–4, page tabs (Harm/Arp chosen), Launchkey status, health slot | Kit additions › App bar, page variant |
| Section row | `24,68 1392×32` | Accomp, count row, Metronome ▾, Unison, Panic, ? | kit › Section row |
| Display page | `24,112 1392×300` | compact block, divider, the Harmony / Arpeggio column | below |
| Band | `24,432 1392×368` | faders, knobs, pads, transport and tempo | kit › Full band |
| Status line | `24,800 1392×20` | `state.message` | kit › Status line |
| Keys | `24,820 1392×56` | the key strip, 61 keys | kit › Key strip |

Vertical rhythm: app bar, 8, section row, 12, display page, 20, band, 20 (the status line),
keys: 24 + 36 + 8 + 32 + 12 + 300 + 20 + 368 + 20 + 56 + 24 = 900.

## Display page

`24,112 1392×300`, ground, `position: relative`, `overflow: hidden`, no border (unlike the
Stage's display, Stage.md D42: this is a page, not the Stage's display; HA-D21). Inside, the
content box is `48,128 1344×268` (24 left and right, 16 top and bottom), a row, gap 24:

| Part | Box | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| Left column | `48,128 320×268` | the compact now-playing block at its top (`48,128 320×84`); the 184px under it is empty ground (the board's "air") |
| Divider | `392,128 1×268` | 1px `--line`, `aria-hidden` |
| Right column | `417,128 975×268` | a column: header, categories, the lists row |

The right column, top to bottom (heights; the rest, 24px at the bottom, is empty):

| Part | Box | Height |
|---|---|---|
| Header | `417,128 975×36` | 36 |
| Category tabs | `417,172 975×32` | 32, 8 below the header |
| Lists row | `417,212 975×160` | 160, 8 below the tabs: the type grid `417,212 580×160`, gap 24, the settings column `1021,212 371×160` |

### Compact now-playing block

Kit additions › Compact now-playing block, at `48,128 320×84`, reading the same fields as
the Stage's display. Nothing on this page differs from the kit's definition.

### Header

`417,128 975×36`, one row, `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line)` (border-box: 35px of
content over the hairline), items centred, gap 12, no wrap. It is a `role="group"` with
`aria-label` "Harmony / Arpeggio: {typeName}, {on | off}" ("Harmony / Arpeggio: Standard Duet
1, on"; empty name: "Harmony / Arpeggio: no type, on").

| Control | Face | Reads | Sends / does | Tooltip | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Title | "Harmony / Arpeggio" 14 / 400 `--m`; not a control | — | — | — | — |
| Type name | 14 / 400 `--t`, `min-width: 0`, ellipsis; not a control | `harmonyArp.typeName`; empty (library not loaded, or no name yet): "—" in `--d` | — | — | — |
| Category caption | 13 / 400 `--m`, gap 12 after the name; shown only in two cases (HA-D3), else absent; not a control | `mode` `harmony` with `harmonyArp.category` exactly "Echo": "Echo"; `mode` `arpeggio` with a non-empty `category`: "Arpeggio · {category}" ("Arpeggio · Up & Down"); any other case (the Harmony category, an empty or unknown category): no caption | — | — | — |
| On | LampButton `size md` (32 tall, padding 0 16, 14px), `margin-left: auto`, label "On" when lit and "Off" when not (HA-D4), code "Fader button 5" (12px, 6px after the label, `--code-opacity` when lit) | `harmonyArp.on` (`aria-pressed`, the face and the label all from this one field: the lamp is controlled by its `on` prop and keeps no state of its own, as every lamp on the band; a click sends and waits for the state) | `toggleHarmonyArp` | `harmony.switch` | fader button 5 (Panel page); the band's Harm/Arp lamp is the same switch |

`aria-label` of the lamp: "Harmony/Arpeggio on (fader button 5)" / "Harmony/Arpeggio off
(fader button 5)". Keyboard shortcut Shift+J (the `J` entry in `app/src/lib/keys.ts`, exists).

### Category tabs

`417,172 975×32`, one row, items centred, no wrap, gap 0 (the separator's margins and the
label's right margin are the only spaces; tabs inside a group touch). Two tab groups and a
label:

- **Harmony categories** (`role="group"` `aria-label="Harmony categories"`): three ChosenTabs
  `size row` (Kit additions): "Harmony", "Echo", "Multi Assign", padding 0 10, 13 / 400. Fixed:
  they don't come from the library (HA-D2).
- A 1 × 16 `--line` separator, 10px margins each side (`aria-hidden`).
- "Arpeggio" 13 / 400 `--m`, 4px right margin; not a control.
- **Arpeggio categories** (`role="group"` `aria-label="Arpeggio categories"`): one ChosenTabs
  `size row` per distinct `category` of `library().arpPatterns`, in order of first appearance,
  labelled as the state gives it ("Up & Down", "Random", "As Played", "Chord Stab", "Broken
  Chord", "Guitar", "Sequence" with today's library; HA-D2), padding 0 10 (the board's 9px was a
  fit tweak; at 10 the row is about 880px wide, inside 975). Patterns with an empty
  `category` go under a last tab "Other" (HA-D28; none today). Library not loaded: no tabs
  after the "Arpeggio" label.

The chosen tab (`aria-pressed="true"`, chosen face as a 24px block centred in the 32px row,
`--g` text, weight 400, HA-D14's one rule for every `row` tab) is the **viewed category** (HA-D1): an
app-only value `{ group: 'harmony' | 'arpeggio', name }` the page wiring keeps while the page
is mounted. On mount, and whenever the selected type changes (`harmonyArp.mode`,
`harmonyType` or `arpPattern` changes, from anywhere: the screen, the hardware, a rack load),
it is the selected type's category; a click on a tab sets it to that tab until the next such
change. The selected type's category is: `mode` `arpeggio` → `{ arpeggio, harmonyArp.category }`
(an empty category → `{ arpeggio, "Other" }`, the tab HA-D28 gives such patterns);
`mode` `harmony` → `{ harmony, "Multi Assign" }` when `harmonyArp.typeName` is "Multi Assign",
else `{ harmony, harmonyArp.category }` ("Harmony" or "Echo"; any other value counts as
"Harmony", HA-D20). When the viewed category has no tab (mode `arpeggio` with an empty
`arpPatterns`): no tab is chosen and the grid is empty; when the list arrives, the tab appears
chosen. Clicking a tab only changes what the grid shows; it sends nothing, so browsing never
stops an Echo or an arpeggio (changing the type does, app-api.md › Keyboard Harmony /
Arpeggio). Clicking the chosen tab does nothing (cursor stays `pointer`: it is an enabled
control). Unchosen tabs: `--m` text, no face. Tooltip `harmony.category` (new, C-HA1) on every
tab. The category tabs replace the kit's tab label rule with their own `aria-label`:
"{name}: {n} types" / "{name}: {n} patterns", "1 type" / "1 pattern" in the singular
("Harmony: 19 types", "Multi Assign: 1 type", "Up & Down: 5 patterns"), plus ", selected
type here" when the selected type is in it; ChosenTabs appends ", chosen" to the chosen one
as to every tab ("Harmony: 19 types, selected type here, chosen"). No Launchkey mapping (the hardware has no type control beyond the switch).

### Type grid

`417,212 580×160`, a `role="group"` `aria-label` "{viewed category} types" / "... patterns"
("Harmony types", "Up & Down patterns"), a grid `repeat(4, minmax(0, 1fr))`, `grid-auto-rows:
32px`, column-gap 12, no row gap (cells 136 × 32), filled row by row. Its items are the types
of the viewed category:

| Viewed category | Items | Index sent with |
|---|---|---|
| Harmony | the entries of `library().harmonyTypes` whose `category` is not "Echo" and whose `name` is not "Multi Assign" (19 today, Data List order; an entry with a category the page doesn't know lists here, HA-D28) | `setHarmonyType { index }`, the entry's index in `harmonyTypes` |
| Echo | the entries whose `category` is "Echo" (Echo, Tremolo, Trill) | `setHarmonyType { index }` |
| Multi Assign | the entry named "Multi Assign" | `setHarmonyType { index }` |
| an arpeggio category | the entries of `library().arpPatterns` with that `category` ("Other": those with an empty one) | `setArpPattern { index }`, the entry's index in `arpPatterns` |

Each item is a button, 32 tall, padding 0 8, 14px, left-aligned, `min-width: 0`, no wrap,
ellipsis, radius 0, `border-top: 1px solid var(--line)` (border-box; the first row's hairline
is on the 212 line, and no hairline closes the last row): a hairline list. The **selected
type** is the entry at `harmonyArp.harmonyType` in `harmonyTypes` when `mode` is `harmony`,
else the entry at `harmonyArp.arpPattern` in `arpPatterns` (by index; `typeName` and
`category` are the engine's reading of the same index, HA-D23). It wears the chosen face:
`--t` fill, `--g` label, weight 500, and its top hairline is transparent (the block replaces
it); `aria-pressed="true"`. Every other item: no fill, `--t2` label, weight 400,
`aria-pressed="false"`. Cells past the last item are empty grid cells, not buttons and not
drawn (HA-D5). More than 20 items (five rows) would overflow the 160px: today's longest list is
19 and the grid clips (`overflow: hidden`); a longer library is a follow-up. Because the grid
clips and the cells touch, an item's focus ring is drawn inside it: `outline-offset: -2px`
(the kit's 1px `--focus` outline otherwise). Click: the command in the table; nothing when the
item is already selected (HA-D1; cursor stays `pointer`). Tooltip `harmony.type` on a
Harmony-list item, `harmony.pattern` on a pattern. `aria-label` "{name}" plus ", selected" when
selected. `data-face="chosen"` on the selected item (Stage.md D41). Library lists empty (the
app's `library` starts with empty `harmonyTypes` and `arpPatterns` until `session.library()`
returns): the grid is empty; the header still names the type from `harmonyArp.typeName`.

### Settings column

`1021,212 371×160`, a column of rows, a `role="group"` with `aria-label` "{typeName}
settings" ("Standard Duet 1 settings"; empty name: "Settings"). Which rows it has is the
**kind** of the selected type, the first that applies:

| Kind | When | Rows, top to bottom (heights sum to 160 or less) |
|---|---|---|
| `arpeggio` | `mode` `arpeggio` | spec #527 (Harmony-Arp). Until it lands: Assign 44 (without Multi) · Volume 44 · More 36 (HA-D15) |
| `multi` | `typeName` "Multi Assign" | Note 44 (HA-D10) |
| `echo` | `category` "Echo" | Assign 44 · Volume 44 · Speed 36 · Touch limit 36 (HA-D9) |
| `harmony` | anything else | Assign 44 · Volume 44 · Touch limit 36 · Chord note only 36 |

Every row has `border-top: 1px solid var(--line)` (box-sizing border-box), items centred, gap
12, no wrap. The ChoiceRow and BarRow shapes start with a **label** cell 64 wide (`flex:
none`, `white-space: nowrap`, `overflow: visible`: "Touch limit" at 13px is about 64px and may
run a pixel or two into the gap), 13 / 400 `--m`; the SettingsLampRow, Note and More rows have no
label cell, so their content starts at the row's left edge (x 1021). Three row shapes carry
every setting (Kit additions › Settings rows): a **ChoiceRow** (tabs), a **BarRow** (a value
with a bar) and a **SettingsLampRow** (lamp buttons). The rows:

| Row | Shape | Label | Face | Reads | Sends | Tooltip | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Assign | ChoiceRow 44; its tab group (the one `role="group"`, the ChosenTabs' own) is labelled "Assign: which Right parts sound the effect" | "Assign" | tabs Auto, Multi, R1, R2, R3; Multi only in the `harmony` and `echo` kinds (RM p.46) | `harmonyArp.assign`: `auto` → Auto, `multi` → Multi, `right1..3` → R1..R3; in the `arpeggio` kind a `multi` shows Auto chosen (it plays as Auto), and clicking Auto then sends `auto` (HA-D27) | `setHarmonyAssign { assign }` | `harmony.assign` | — |
| Volume | BarRow 44, slider 0–127 | "Volume" over a second line (HA-D8) | the bar and the value | `harmonyArp.volume` | `setHarmonyVolume { volume }` | `harmony.volume` | the knob of the Rack knob page whose target is `harmonyVolume` (knob 5 with the default map); a Panel fader with that target |
| Touch limit | BarRow 36, slider 1–127 | "Touch limit" | the bar and the value | `harmonyArp.touchLimit` | `setTouchLimit { velocity }` | `harmony.touch_limit` | — |
| Chord note only | SettingsLampRow 36 | none | LampButton `size sm` "Chord note only" | `harmonyArp.chordNoteOnly` | `setChordNoteOnly { on: !chordNoteOnly }` | `harmony.chord_note_only` | — |
| Speed | ChoiceRow 36; its tab group labelled "Speed: the repeat rate" | "Speed" | ChosenTabs `row-sm` 1/4, 1/6, 1/8, 1/12, 1/16, 1/32 (28 tall, 22px block, 13px, padding 0 8) | `harmonyArp.speed` | `setHarmonySpeed { speed }` | `harmony.speed` | — |
| Note | 44 tall, a hairline-topped row of text; no label cell | none | "Multi Assign has no settings: each right-hand key goes to Right 1, 2 and 3 in turn." 13 / 400 `--m`, line-height 16, wrapping, starting at the row's left edge (no padding), centred vertically; not a control | — | — | — | — |
| More | 36 tall, a hairline-topped row; no label cell (interim, HA-D15) | none | a text button "Quantize, Hold, Velocity, Keep Key On…" 13 / 400 `--t2`, left-aligned, centred vertically; `aria-label` "More arpeggio settings: Quantize, Hold, Velocity, Keep Key On. Opens the Harmony/Arpeggio panel" | — | opens today's Harmony drawer (`ui.toggleDrawer('harmony')`, opened, not toggled closed), where those settings are until #527 | `harmony.more` (new, C-HA1) | — |

Assign tabs: ChosenTabs `size row` (Auto and Multi padding 0 10, 13 / 400 `--m` unchosen) and
the three part tabs R1, R2, R3 (padding 0 8, 13 / 500, in `--r1`, `--r2`, `--r3` when
unchosen, `data-hue`). The chosen tab wears the chosen face, a 24px white block with `--g`
text, whichever it is: a chosen R1 loses its hue and its `data-hue` (HA-D14: `data-hue` says
what colour is drawn). `aria-label`s "Auto", "Multi", "Right 1", "Right 2", "Right 3", plus ",
chosen" on the chosen one. Clicking the chosen tab sends nothing. Speed's tabs follow the same
rules: `aria-label` "1/4" … "1/32" plus ", chosen", `data-face="chosen"` on the chosen one,
`--m` text unchosen, and the chosen tab sends nothing. "Chosen" here is the state's value
(HA-D27): the ChoiceRow passes `chosen` as the state's value and a tab whose id equals it is
inert; the arpeggio kind's Auto-for-`multi` is a drawn chosen face (the row passes `drawn:
'auto'`) over a `chosen` of `multi`, so Auto still sends.

Volume's label is two lines (gap 1): "Volume" 13 / 400, line-height 16, `--m`, over "Knob {n}"
12 / 400, line-height 14, `--d`, where `n` is 1 + the index of the first entry of
`liveRack.controls.knobs` whose `kind` is `harmonyVolume` (5 with the default map); no such
knob: the second line is absent and the label is one line (HA-D8). Touch limit's label is one
line. Speed's tabs are 28 tall (a 22px block) so the row keeps 36.

BarRow drawing (both sliders), from the label: the **bar** (`flex: 1`, `aria-hidden`) is a 2px
`--past` track with a 2px `--t2` fill from the left, `width: value / 127 × 100%` (Volume 100 →
78.7%; Touch limit 1 → 0.8%, a hairline of fill, HA-D16); then the **value** 44 wide (`flex:
none`), right-aligned, 22 / 300, line-height 24, `--t`, the integer. The row is one
`<div role="slider" tabindex="0">` with `aria-label` "Volume" / "Touch limit",
`aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, `aria-valuenow` and `aria-valuetext` "Volume 100 of 127" /
"Touch limit 1 of 127". Pointer (HA-D7, as the fader's, Stage.md D23): press anywhere on the
row and drag horizontally, with pointer capture; `value = clamp(round(v0 + (x − x0) × 127 /
w), min, max)` with `v0`, `x0` the value and pointer x at pointerdown and `w` the bar
element's `getBoundingClientRect().width` read at pointerdown (239 at 1440: 371 − 64 − 12 − 12
− 44), never a jump to the pointer. A send goes out when the whole-number value changes, at
most once per animation frame: a move stores the new value first, then schedules one
`requestAnimationFrame` if none is pending (the handle is kept in `frame`, 0 when none); the
frame's callback clears `frame` and sends the stored value if it differs from the baseline:
`shown` (`pending ?? state`) at pointerdown, then each value the gesture sent (so a drag
back to a value the row sent earlier, after the state moved elsewhere, still sends). On
pointerup the row cancels the pending frame (`cancelAnimationFrame`, `frame` = 0) and sends
the stored value once if it differs from that baseline (HA-D26; a click without movement
sends nothing). The row draws and steps from the value it last sent until
the state's value changes, then from the state (HA-D7). Wheel, keys and double-click send at
once, not through the frame. Wheel: one step per wheel event by the sign of `deltaY`
(negative, up: +1; positive: −1; zero: nothing; `deltaX` is ignored). Keys: ArrowRight and
ArrowUp +1, ArrowLeft and ArrowDown −1, PageUp/PageDown ±10, Home/End to min/max (the slider
stops propagation, kit › Interaction conventions); double-click resets Volume to 100 and Touch
limit to 1 (one send, of the default, when it differs). Cursor `pointer`, `ew-resize` while
dragging.

Chord note only: LampButton `size sm` (28 tall, 13px; the board's 30px rounds to the kit's
size, HA-D6), centred vertically in its 36px row, left-aligned, label "Chord note only", no
code, `aria-pressed` = `chordNoteOnly`; `aria-label` "Chord note only, on" / ", off".

## Band, keys and status on this page

The kit's full band, key strip and status line, unchanged, as on the Stage (Stage.md › Band,
keys and status on the Stage). The Harm/Arp lamp in the lamp row reads `harmonyArp.on`, so it
is lit while the header's On is: the same switch, drawn twice on purpose (the band is the
hardware's mirror; the header is the page's). The knobs show whatever page `knobs.page` is: on
the Rack page knob 5 ("Harm level", Stage.md D6) is this page's Volume.

## States

| State | What changes |
|---|---|
| Standard Duet 1, on (the board) | as drawn: kind `harmony`; Harmony tab chosen; the first grid item the white block; Assign Auto; Volume 100 "Knob 5"; Touch limit 1; Chord note only off |
| Switch off | header lamp reads "Off", off face; band Harm/Arp lamp off; nothing else changes (the type and settings stay) |
| An Echo type (Echo, Tremolo, Trill) | header caption "Echo"; Echo tab chosen; grid of three; kind `echo`: Assign, Volume, Speed, Touch limit |
| Multi Assign | Multi Assign tab chosen; grid of one; kind `multi`: the note only |
| An arpeggio pattern | caption "Arpeggio · {category}"; that arpeggio tab chosen; grid of its patterns; kind `arpeggio` (#527; interim per HA-D15: Assign, Volume, and the More row to today's drawer) |
| Harm/Arp tab or Alt+H pressed while on this page and nothing is open over it | back to the Stage (`ui.page` `stage`), as the drawer toggled closed (HA-D24) |
| Harm/Arp tab or Alt+H pressed while an interim drawer or the Library is open over this page | the drawer closes (`ui.view` back to `stage`), the page stays, its tab is chosen again (the kit's "entering a page closes every drawer first"; HA-D24) |
| Esc on this page | runs `ui.escape()` (drawers and overlays close first); returns to the Stage only when nothing was open (HA-D24) |
| Help mode until #508 lands | `?` has `aria-pressed` = `help` and calls `onhelp()` (`tips.toggleHelp()`); nothing else on the page changes, and today's `HelpFooter` is not mounted in the page layout (the status line stands where it stood, Stage.md D15) |
| Assign Right 2 | R2 wears the white block (no hue); R1 and R3 keep their hues |
| Assign Multi, then an arpeggio | Auto shows chosen; Multi absent |
| Browsing another category | that tab chosen; the grid shows its items with no white block (the selected type is elsewhere); the header and settings keep the selected type |
| Type changed from the hardware or a rack load (`mode`, `harmonyType` or `arpPattern` changes) | the viewed category snaps to the selected type's; its block shows |
| Library lists empty (not loaded yet) | empty grid; three Harmony tabs, no arpeggio tabs; header names `typeName` ("—" when empty); in mode `arpeggio` no tab is chosen |
| Rack map without a Harmony volume knob | Volume's "Knob n" line absent |
| Stopped band | compact block: the run dot hidden, the section in `--m` (Kit additions › Compact block) |
| No chord | compact block chord "—" in `--d`, no tones |
| No Launchkey | app bar status hollow dot; fader button 5 is still the switch on screen; everything works |
| A refusal or notice | the status line |
| Help mode | spec #508 |

Light theme: the same markup; only tokens change (kit › Tokens). The chord's `--ba` is `none`
in light; the page has no other glow of its own.

## Board fixture

The state and moment that reproduce the board, for the `Pages/Harmony` › `Board` story and its
shots: `app/src/ui/Harmony/Harmony.fixtures.ts` exports `boardState` (a full `AppState`),
`boardLibrary` (a `LibraryList`), `boardNow`, `boardReceivedMs` and `boardMeterHolds`.
`boardState` is the Stage's `boardState` (`app/src/ui/Stage/Stage.fixtures.ts`, Stage.md ›
Board fixture: the same clock, transport, chord, parts, faders, meters, knobs, pads and keys)
with these fields replaced; `boardNow` (10000) and `boardMeterHolds` are the Stage's, and
`boardReceivedMs` is 10000 (Stage.md › Board fixture names the value; its fixture file doesn't
export it, so this one does):

- `harmonyArp`: on true, mode "harmony", harmonyType 0, arpPattern 0, typeName "Standard Duet
  1", category "Harmony", volume 100, speed "1/8", assign "auto", chordNoteOnly false,
  touchLimit 1, arp { quantize "off", hold false, pedalHold false, velocity "original",
  fixedVelocity 100, keepKeyOn false }.
- `liveRack.controls`: the default map (`defaultControlMap()` in `app/src/lib/api/types.ts`):
  knobs 5 `harmonyVolume`, so Volume reads "Knob 5".
- `boardLibrary` (the lists are not in `AppState`: the app keeps them in `app.library`, from
  `session.library()`; the page takes them as a `library` prop), a `LibraryList`: the dev
  mock's exported `LIBRARY` (`app/src/lib/api/mock.ts`: revision 1, its style entries, `VOICES`,
  `HARMONY_TYPES` and `ARP_PATTERNS` from `mock-harmony.ts`: the 23 types, Multi Assign at
  index 19 with category "Harmony"; the 23 patterns in seven categories), with the entry whose
  `id` is the fixture's `style.id` given folder "Pop" (the mock's is "Pop & Rock"; Stage.md's
  fixture wants "Pop"; it isn't visible on this page). This page takes no library from the
  Stage's fixture (it exports none).
- Page: the story renders `Harmony` with `page: 'harmArp'` (the active tab is a prop; in the
  app it is `ui.page`, Stage.md D2); the viewed category is the selected type's (Harmony), as
  on mount.
- The band: as the Stage's fixture, with the Harm/Arp lamp lit by `harmonyArp.on`.

Board texts that differ from this fixture on purpose: the count row reads "fill after bar 3",
not the board's 4 (Stage.md D5; masked, as on the Stage); the board's One Touch `aria-label`s
name "Shift + pads 9 to 12", which the Launchkey can't do (Stage.md D16; not a pixel). The
board's category tabs read "UpDown", "AsPlayed", "ChordStab", "BrokenChord" where the spec
draws the state's "Up & Down", "As Played", "Chord Stab", "Broken Chord", and its arpeggio tabs
have 9px padding where the spec has 10 (HA-D2): the tabs row from "Arpeggio" to its end is
masked (`data-shot-mask="arp-tabs"` on the arpeggio group and its label). The light board's
`--m` (`#6e6e6e`) and `--lamp-ink` (`#111`) differ from the tokens (`#646464`, `#000`) within
the per-pixel threshold, as on the Stage (three lamps are lit here: Accomp, Harm/Arp twice).

## Components

Every part of the screen, in build order: a component is built only after everything in its
"Built from" column. Each gets `app/src/ui/<Name>/` with a SPEC.md per
`docs/factory/spec-template.md`; crops come from the board lines below (dark board / light
board; the light board's lines are the dark's minus 10 throughout). "Exists" is whether it is
in `app/src/ui` today; "Stage" means the Stage lane builds it (Stage.md › Components) and this
page reuses it. Components marked **new** are this page's own or its kit additions.

| # | Component | Kind | Built from | Exists | Board lines (dark / light) | Spec |

The band's lamp row (Stage.md component 34) and this page's SettingsLampRow (7) are different
components: the band's is nine cells; this one is a settings row. Also from the Stage lane,
not components: `app/src/ui/Stage/Stage.fixtures.ts` (the fixture's base), the
`app/src/pages/` wiring pattern, `ui.page`, and the shots masks.

Components take props and call callbacks; none reads `app.state`, `app.library`, `ui`, `tips`
or sends. The `Harmony` page component's interface (HA-D25):

| Prop | Type | From (in the wiring) | What it drives |
|---|---|---|---|
| `state` | `AppState` | `app.state` | everything the engine owns |
| `library` | `LibraryList` | `app.library` | the arpeggio tabs and the grid |
| `page` | `Page` (`ui.page`'s type) | `ui.page` | the app bar's `aria-current` tab |
| `viewed` | `{ group: 'harmony' \| 'arpeggio', name: string } \| null` | the wiring's viewed category | the chosen category tab and the grid's list; **null means "the selected type's category"** (`selectedCategory(state)` below): what a story passes, and what the wiring passes until the first tab click after a snap |
| `now`, `receivedMs`, `meterHolds` | as the Stage's | the wiring's clock and `holdPeak` | the band's blocks, LEDs and meters |
| `shift` | `boolean` | `ui.shift` | the kit's Shift behaviour (`shiftAction`, Shift-click on part lamps and master buttons) |
| `keyRange` | `KeyRange \| null` (`49 \| 61 \| 88`; null = the connected Launchkey's, the kit's Key strip rule) | `ui.keyRange` | the key strip |
| `help` | `boolean` | `tips.help` | the `?` button's `aria-pressed` |
| `selectedPart` | `number` | `ui.selectedPart` | the Channel tab's interim target |
| `open` | `{ nav: string \| null, channel: boolean }` | `nav`: the `label` of the `NAV` entry (`app/src/lib/nav.ts`) whose `open()` is true, taken in this order so the most specific wins: "Quick Racks" before "Library", and never the page's own entry ("Harmony/Arp", whose `open()` is true throughout); null when none; `channel`: the Channel interim is showing (`channelNav`) | which app bar tab is drawn chosen while something is open over the page: the tab whose label equals `open.nav` ("Effects", "Quick Racks", "Multi Pads", "Looper", "Library", "Settings"), or Channel when `open.channel` (Channel wins when both are set: it is the later opener); the page's own tab when both are empty (Kit additions › App bar). An open Styles browser, Rack, Charts, Harmony drawer or Mixer (no tab of their own) chooses no tab: the page's tab stays chosen |

Callbacks: `onsend(cmd)` (every `AppCmd`), `onpage(page)` (a tab whose page is built, and
the page's own tab: HA-D24 says what the wiring does then), `onnav(label)` (a tab whose page
isn't built yet: the wiring runs that `NAV` entry's `toggle()`, the kit's rule), `onviewed(category)`
(a category tab click), `ondrawer(name)` (an interim target that opens and never toggles
closed: the More row `'harmony'`, the rack readout and the band's rack-target strip names
`'rack'`, the Multi Pad strip name `'multipad'`, the Master strip name `'effects'`; the wiring
runs `ui.toggleDrawer(name)` only when that drawer is closed, which also closes the others as
`toggleDrawer` does), `onsettings(tab)` (the health slot: the wiring opens the Settings drawer
on that tab, `ui.toggleDrawer('settings')` only when closed, then the tab setter of
`panels/settings/nav.svelte.ts`, the Stage's D32 Settings target), `onbrowser()` (the style
name), `onchannel(part)` (the kit's Channel openers and the Channel tab, which passes
`selectedPart`), `onhelp()` (the `?` button: `tips.toggleHelp()`, which is not a command). No
`onlibrary`: this page has no sound cells. A kit part that needs none of these reads only
what it is given. Which tab calls `onpage` and which `onnav` is a constant in the page
(`BUILT_PAGES`, today `['stage', 'harmArp']`; each page lane adds its own) that the page
passes to the kit's `PageTabs` as a `built` prop, with `open` as a prop too; if the Stage's
`PageTabs` lacks them, `app/src/ui/PageTabs/` joins the edits table with that addition. The
Channel interim on this page: `Harmony` takes an optional `display` snippet (Svelte 5); when
given, it is rendered in the Display page's box (`24,112 1392×300`) in place of `HarmonyPage`,
and the wiring passes today's `ChannelView` in it while `channelNav.open`, as `App.svelte`
does for the Stage today; the band and keys stay.

Pure functions, in `app/src/ui/CategoryTabs/categories.ts`: `selectedCategory(state)` → the
`{ group, name }` of Category tabs (from `mode`, `typeName`, `category`); `categoriesOf(library)`
→ the arpeggio categories in order of first appearance; `itemsOf(library, viewed)` → the grid's
`{ index, name }[]` for a viewed category (the rules of Type grid). The wiring, the stories and
Checks 2 and 3 use them.

The page wiring (`app/src/pages/HarmonyWiring.svelte`, outside `app/src/ui`, the Stage's
pattern, Stage.md D46) reads `app.state`, `app.library`, `ui` and `tips`, keeps `now` (once per
animation frame), `receivedMs`, the meter holds (`holdPeak`) and the viewed category (set by
`onviewed`, reset to null whenever `mode`, `harmonyType` or `arpPattern` changes: the snap of
Category tabs), passes them down, and maps each callback to `app.send`, `ui.page` (or the
HA-D24 rule for the page's own tab), a `NAV` entry's `toggle()`, `ui.toggleDrawer`,
`ui.openLibrary`, `ui.browser`, `tips.toggleHelp` or the Channel interim.
`App.svelte` mounts one wiring by `ui.page`: the Stage lane's `StageWiring` for `stage`,
`HarmonyWiring` for `harmArp` (each page lane adds its own branch; the D1 scaler wraps whichever
is mounted).

**Files this page owns:** `app/src/ui/Harmony/` (the page, its fixtures, stories, crops and
tests), `app/src/ui/HarmonyHeader/`, `CategoryTabs/`, `TypeGrid/`, `SettingsColumn/`,
`HarmonyPage/`, `CompactNowPlaying/`, `BarRow/`, `ChoiceRow/`, `SettingsLampRow/` (not
`LampRow/`: that folder is the band's lamp row, Stage.md component 34), and
`app/src/pages/HarmonyWiring.svelte`. **Edits outside them**, each the smallest addition, made
after the Stage lane has landed so the two lanes never touch a file at once (HA-D25):

| File | Edit |
|---|---|
| `app/src/App.svelte` | the `harmArp` branch that mounts `HarmonyWiring`; today's `HelpFooter` stays mounted below the scaled page as it is (its fate is #508's) |
| `app/src/lib/nav.ts` | the Harm/Arp entry: `open: () => ui.page === 'harmArp'`, `toggle: () => enterHarmArp()`, where `enterHarmArp()` (exported from `HarmonyWiring.svelte`'s sibling `app/src/pages/harmArp.ts`, this lane's file) is the one HA-D24 rule the tab's `onpage('harmArp')` also runs: if `ui.page !== 'harmArp'`, close everything open (`ui.toggleDrawer`'s closing of each drawer flag, `ui.browser`, `ui.mixer`, `ui.harmony`, `ui.view = 'stage'`, `channelNav.close()`) and set `ui.page = 'harmArp'`; else if anything is open over the page, close it the same way and stay; else `ui.page = 'stage'` |
| `app/src/lib/store.svelte.ts` | `ui.escape()`: the `ui.page` branch (HA-D24), unless the Stage lane's D2 work already added it |
| `app/src/help/coverage.test.ts` | three `STATES` entries whose setup also assigns `app.library = LIBRARY` (the mock's export, so the lists are there synchronously; the fetch is a promise the test never awaits): `['Harm/Arp page', …]` (`ui.page = 'harmArp'`), `['Harm/Arp page, Echo type', …]` (also sends `setHarmonyType { index: 21 }`) and `['Harm/Arp page, arpeggio', …]` (also sends `setArpPattern { index: 0 }`: the More row), so Check 15 covers every row; and `ui.page = 'stage'` in the file's `afterEach` |
| `app/src/ui/tokens/scale.css`, `Foundations.mdx` | the tokens under Kit additions › Tokens to add, and their rows in the foundations page (storybook axiom 6) |
| `app/src/ui/ChosenTabs/` | the `row` and `row-sm` sizes (Kit additions) |
| `app/src/ui/ChordReadout/` | the `compact` size and `fit.ts` (`compactChordSize`) |
| `app/src/ui/AccentBlock/` | the `sm` size (the compact block's style name) |
| `app/src/ui/RackReadout/` | the `inline` variant |
| `app/src/ui/AppBar/` | the `page` variant (the rack readout and One Touch slots) |
| `app/src/ui/LampButton/` | only if the Stage lane's LampButton isn't yet controlled with `data-face` and `tip` (Stage.md D41 asks for `data-face`; its component 2 names only `join`, `onlongpress`, `onlongrelease`): then the controlled `on`, `data-face` and `tip` from Gap below |

The Stage lane builds none of the new sizes and variants (Stage.md doesn't list them); the
Components table's "Stage (add …)" means the component is the Stage's and this lane adds to it
once the Stage has landed.

## Gap against today

| Area | In `app/src` now | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Harmony / Arpeggio | `panels/harmony/Harmony.svelte`: a drawer (`Overlay`, `ui.harmony`) with a Toggle, the type name, ◀ ▶ step buttons, a Harmony / Arpeggio `Choice`, one list grouped by category, and `Field` / `HSlider` / `Choice` / `Toggle` settings | Replaced by the page: a display tab (`ui.page` `harmArp`, Stage.md D2), category tabs instead of the mode choice and the grouped list, the settings column; no step buttons (HA-D11). The drawer and its tests (`Harmony.test.ts`) stay in the code, the drawer reached only from the arpeggio kind's More row, until #527 lands (HA-D15); then both go, and the page's checks (below) are the page's own from the start |
| Navigation | `lib/nav.ts`: Harmony/Arp Alt+H toggles the drawer | The tab and Alt+H set `ui.page` `harmArp`, and back to `stage` from the page (kit › App bar, D2; HA-D24); Esc on the page returns to the Stage |
| Shortcuts | `lib/keys.ts`: `J` (Shift+J) toggles the switch, `L` (Shift+L) steps the type, `*` toggles Arpeggio Hold | Unchanged (HA-D11) |
| Compact block | none (the Stage display's chord and tempo are 128px and 32px) | New, from the kit addition below; shares `splitChord`, the tone spelling and the fit maths with the Stage's ChordReadout |
| App bar | Stage lane's AppBar (page tabs, status, health) | The page variant adds the rack readout and One Touch after the wordmark |
| Settings rows | `panels/settings/Field.svelte`, `HSlider.svelte`, `Choice.svelte` (old tokens) | The kit's rows (BarRow, ChoiceRow, SettingsLampRow), which the Settings pages (#528–#533) can reuse |
| LampButton | `app/src/ui/LampButton/LampButton.svelte` (#499): keeps its own `pressed`, flips it on click and calls `ontoggle(newState)`; no `data-face`, no `tip` prop | Controlled: the `on` prop is the only source of the face, `aria-pressed` and the label; a click calls `ontoggle(!on)` without flipping anything; `data-face` ("on" / "off" / "record" / "disabled"); a `tip` prop that puts `use:tip` on its button. Stage.md component 2 lists `join`, `onlongpress` and `onlongrelease`; this page needs these three too, and whichever lane builds LampButton first makes all of them |
| Screenshot tool | `app/scripts/shots.ts` (one 1000 × 600 viewport, no masks) | The Stage lane's per-story viewport and masks (Stage.md D39); this page adds a second mask |

## Contract changes needed

C-HA1 blocks the build (a tooltip key: without it `TipKey` doesn't type-check and the tooltip
catalog test fails); it lands with the Stage's C5 or as its own small PR. The Stage's C5 already
covers `nav.harmony` (its body says "opens the panel"; the rewrite to "shows the page" is C5's
rule for every `nav.*`). Nothing else on this page needs the API to change.

1. **C-HA1 · Tooltips** (`app/src/help/tooltips.ts`; then `app/docs/controls.md`
   regenerated with `npm run docs:controls` in `app/`, since `controls-doc.test.ts` requires
   the file to equal the render), **lands before the build**. Two new keys in the Keyboard
   Harmony / Arpeggio group: `harmony.category`, the full entry `{ title: 'Category', body:
   'Shows this category\'s Harmony types or arpeggio patterns. The type you have stays until
   you pick another.', genos: 'Keyboard Harmony / Arpeggio type', keys: [], launchkey: null }`,
   and `harmony.more`, `{ title: 'More arpeggio settings', body: 'Opens the Harmony/Arpeggio
   panel for Quantize, Hold, Velocity and Keep Key On, until they are on this page.', genos:
   'Arpeggio', keys: [], launchkey: null }` (removed with #527). And `harmony.volume` gains
   `launchkey: 'Knob 5 on the Rack knob page (with the default controller map); a Panel fader
   mapped to Harmony volume'` (today null). Keys the page no longer uses stay in the catalog
   for now (`harmony.mode_harmony`, `harmony.mode_arpeggio`, `harmony.prev_type`,
   `harmony.next_type`, `harmony.close`); dropping them is a follow-up with the drawer's
   removal.
2. **Suggested, not needed (follow-up):** give Multi Assign its own `category` ("Multi Assign")
   in `harmonyTypes` (`crates/yahaha-core/src/harmony.rs` `Category`, `tests/fixtures/library.json`,
   the dev mocks, app-api.md) so the screen needn't group it by name (HA-D2). Until then, and
   without it, the page groups by name.

## Checks

Vitest (`npx vitest run` on the page and component tests), each against the board fixture
unless it says otherwise. They read roles, names, attributes and the commands sent (a fake
`send`), and the `data-face` / `data-hue` hooks (kit › Faces, Stage.md D41); never computed
colours or layout. Checks that cross the wiring (the viewed category, the page setter, the
drawer opener: 2, 7, 17) render `HarmonyWiring` with no session attached: they assign
`app.state = boardState` and `app.library = boardLibrary` directly (both are plain `$state`
fields of the `app` store; with no session, nothing fetches or ticks over them; a later step
of a check assigns a changed state the same way, then `flushSync()`), set `ui.page =
'harmArp'`, and stub `app.send` with `vi.spyOn(app, 'send').mockImplementation(() => {})` to
record commands (`app.send` with no session is already a no-op). The rest render the pure
components with props and a recorded `onsend`. Pointer checks stub
`requestAnimationFrame` to run its callback at once and return 0 (`vi.stubGlobal('requestAnimationFrame',
(cb) => (cb(0), 0))`; the callback clears `frame` itself, so the returned 0 leaves nothing
pending) and `cancelAnimationFrame` to a no-op, so a move's frame send happens synchronously.
Because a pure row steps from the value it last sent (HA-D7) and a recorded `onsend` never
echoes a state, every sub-step of a slider check that names a starting value is its own
render at that value.

1. Header: the group's `aria-label` is "Harmony / Arpeggio: Standard Duet 1, on"; the lamp
   reads "On", has `aria-pressed="true"` and `data-face="on"`, and a click sends
   `toggleHarmonyArp`; with `on` false it reads "Off". With category "Echo" the caption reads
   "Echo"; with mode "arpeggio" and category "Up & Down", "Arpeggio · Up & Down"; with
   category "Harmony", no caption element.
2. Category tabs: the Harmony group has three tabs, the arpeggio group seven, named "Up &
   Down" … "Sequence" (from the mock's `ARP_PATTERNS`); "Harmony" is `aria-pressed="true"`
   (`data-face="chosen"`) and its `aria-label` "Harmony: 19 types, selected type here, chosen".
   Clicking "Echo" sends nothing and the grid then lists Echo, Tremolo, Trill with no
   `data-face="chosen"` item; the header still reads "Standard Duet 1". Then a state with mode
   "arpeggio", `arpPattern` 13, `typeName` "Alberti 16", category "Broken Chord": the "Broken
   Chord" tab is chosen and the grid shows four patterns with "Alberti 16" chosen. With an
   empty `arpPatterns`, no arpeggio tabs, and in mode "arpeggio" no tab is chosen. Pure:
   `selectedCategory(boardState)` is `{ group: 'harmony', name: 'Harmony' }`, with `typeName`
   "Multi Assign" `{ harmony, 'Multi Assign' }`, with an empty `category` `{ harmony,
   'Harmony' }` (HA-D20); `categoriesOf(boardLibrary)` is the seven names in order; a pattern
   with an empty category adds "Other" last (HA-D28).
3. Type grid: 19 items in Data List order, "Standard Duet 1" `aria-pressed="true"`; clicking
   "Block" sends `setHarmonyType { index: 8 }`; clicking the chosen item sends nothing; the
   grid has no element for cells 20; on the Multi Assign tab one item, and clicking it sends
   `setHarmonyType { index: 19 }`; on "Random", clicking "Dice 16" sends `setArpPattern { index:
   5 }`. Items on a Harmony list carry `data-tip="harmony.type"`, patterns `harmony.pattern`.
4. Settings column, kind `harmony`: four rows in order Assign, Volume, Touch limit, Chord note
   only; Assign's "Auto" is chosen and clicking "Right 2" sends `setHarmonyAssign { assign:
   'right2' }` (its tab carries `data-hue="r2"` and `aria-label` "Right 2"); with `assign`
   "right2" it is `data-face="chosen"`; "Multi" is present.
5. Kind `echo` (`harmonyType` 21, typeName "Tremolo", category "Echo"): rows Assign, Volume,
   Speed, Touch limit; no Chord note only; Speed has six tabs, "1/8" chosen
   (`data-face="chosen"`), clicking "1/16" sends `setHarmonySpeed { speed: '1/16' }`, clicking
   "1/8" sends nothing.
6. Kind `multi` (`harmonyType` 19, typeName "Multi Assign"): the column (a `role="group"`
   named "Multi Assign settings") holds one row with the note text and no `role="slider"`,
   inner `role="group"` or button.
7. Kind `arpeggio` interim (mode "arpeggio", `arpPattern` 0): rows Assign, Volume and More;
   Assign has no "Multi"; with `assign` "multi", "Auto" wears `data-face="chosen"` and
   clicking it sends `setHarmonyAssign { assign: 'auto' }` (HA-D27); the More button's click
   calls the drawer opener (`ui.toggleDrawer('harmony')` with the drawer closed → open).
8. Volume: `role="slider"` named "Volume", `aria-valuenow` 100, `aria-valuetext` "Volume 100
   of 127"; the label's second line reads "Knob 5"; with a map whose knobs have no
   `harmonyVolume`, no second line; with the bar's `getBoundingClientRect` stubbed to 239px
   wide, a pointerdown then a pointermove 24px to the right then pointerup sends exactly one
   `setHarmonyVolume { volume: 113 }` (100 + round(24 × 127 / 239); the stubbed frame sends it
   on the move and the pointerup finds nothing new to send, HA-D26); with
   `requestAnimationFrame` stubbed to never run, the same gesture still sends exactly one 113,
   on the pointerup; pointerdown and pointerup without a move send nothing; each from a fresh
   render at 100: wheel one notch up sends 101, ArrowDown 99, ArrowRight 101, PageUp 110, End
   127, double-click sends nothing; rendered at 90, double-click sends 100; the bar's fill
   element has `style.width` "78.7%" (one decimal, HA-D16).
9. Touch limit: `role="slider"` named "Touch limit", min 1, `aria-valuetext` "Touch limit 1 of
   127"; ArrowDown at 1 sends nothing; ArrowUp sends `setTouchLimit { velocity: 2 }`;
   double-click at 40 sends 1.
10. Chord note only: `aria-pressed="false"`, `data-face="off"`; a click sends
    `setChordNoteOnly { on: true }`; `aria-label` "Chord note only, off".
11. Bar maths (pure, `app/src/ui/BarRow/bar.ts`): `fillPercent(100, 127)` is "78.7%",
    `fillPercent(1, 127)` "0.8%"; `dragValue(100, 0, 24, 239, 0, 127)` is 113;
    `dragValue(1, 0, −50, 239, 1, 127)` is 1.
12. Compact block: its `aria-label` is "Now playing: Sunday Drive Pop, 104 BPM, running,
    chord Am7, Main B"; the style name reads "Sunday Drive Pop" and a click opens the Browser;
    the tempo reads "104" and "BPM"; the run dot has `data-state="running"`; the chord's base
    run is "Am" and its extension "7"; the tones read "A C E G"; the section reads "Main B"
    with `data-hue="main"`. Stopped (`transport.running` false, `main` 1): the dot has
    `data-state="stopped"`, the section reads "Main B" with `data-hue="m"`, the label ends
    "stopped, chord Am7, Main B". No chord: "—", no tones element, the label says "no chord".
    `transposeKeyboard` 2 with name "Bm7": tones "B D F# A".
13. App bar, page variant: the rack readout reads "Rack A1 Sunday drive" with the modified
    dot, and a click opens the Rack page's interim target (the Rack drawer); without a loaded
    button it reads "Rack Sunday drive"; One Touch 2 is chosen and clicking 3 sends
    `recallOts { index: 2 }`; the Harm/Arp tab has `aria-current="page"`.
14. Band: the Harm/Arp lamp in the lamp row has `aria-pressed="true"`; with `harmonyArp.on`
    false both it and the header lamp are off.
15. Every interactive element has a `data-tip` in the catalog (the existing tooltip test).
16. Keyboard: the Tab order is the DOM order: app bar (the rack readout, One Touch 1–4, the
    page tabs, the health slot when it is a button), section row (Accomp, Metronome, its
    caret, Unison, Panic, ?), the compact block's style name, the header lamp, the category
    tabs (Harmony, Echo, Multi Assign, then the arpeggio tabs), the grid items in order, the
    settings rows top to bottom (Assign tabs, Volume, Touch limit, Chord note only), then the
    band and the status line as the kit orders them. The divider, the title, the type name,
    the tempo, the tones and the section are not focusable.
17. Page: with `ui.page` "harmArp" the Harm/Arp tab has `aria-current="page"`; pressing the
    tab sets `ui.page` to "stage"; with `ui.page` "harmArp" and `ui.effects` true (the Effects
    drawer open), the Effects tab is the chosen one, Harm/Arp is not, and pressing the Harm/Arp
    tab sets `ui.effects` false and leaves `ui.page` "harmArp"; with `ui.rack` true (no tab)
    Harm/Arp stays chosen; calling `ui.escape()` directly (the global
    key handler in `lib/shortcuts.ts` is covered by its own test) with the Harmony drawer open
    closes the drawer and leaves the page as it is; `ui.escape()` again sets `ui.page` to
    "stage" (HA-D24).
18. Fit maths (pure, `app/src/ui/ChordReadout/fit.ts`): `compactChordSize(100, 150)` is
    48, `compactChordSize(200, 150)` is 36, `compactChordSize(300, 150)` is 32.

**Story and screenshot checks** (`npm run shots -- Harmony`, real Chrome), for what jsdom
can't see:

- `Pages/Harmony` › `Board` (export `Board`, layout `fullscreen`, `parameters.shots = {
  viewport: { width: 1440, height: 900 }, mask: ['[data-shot-mask="when"]',
  '[data-shot-mask="arp-tabs"]'] }`) renders `Harmony` with `state: boardState, library:
  boardLibrary, page: 'harmArp', viewed: null, now: boardNow, receivedMs: boardReceivedMs,
  meterHolds: boardMeterHolds, shift: false, keyRange: 61, help: false, selectedPart: 0,
  open: { nav: null, channel: false }`, no `display` snippet and no-op callbacks, unscaled, in both themes, against `app/src/ui/Harmony/crops/Board-dark.png`
  and `Board-light.png` (copies of `docs/design/push/png/Harmony-Dark.png` and
  `Harmony-Light.png`, 1440 × 900): at most 0.02 of the unmasked pixels differ. The arp-tabs
  mask covers the board's spellings and 9px padding (Board fixture); the Chord note only lamp is
  28px against the board's 30 (HA-D6), within the budget.
- The same story covers the chosen blocks, the hairline grid, the bars, the chord's two weights
  and its `--ba` glow (dark) and none (light).
- `Components/SettingsColumn` › `Echo` (typeName "Tremolo") and `MultiAssign`: the four rows
  with Speed, and the note; no crop (the board doesn't draw them), judged by Inspect.
- `Primitives/TypeGrid` › `Browsing` (viewed "Random", selected elsewhere): two items, no white
  block; no crop. (Primitives live under `Primitives/`, `docs/factory/storybook-axioms.md`
  axiom 11; BarRow, ChoiceRow and SettingsLampRow stories go there too.)
- `Components/CategoryTabs` › `Full` (the seven arpeggio categories at 10px padding): the row
  stays one line inside 975px; no crop.
- `Components/CompactNowPlaying` › `LongChord` (`name: "C#m7b5/G#"`): the chord shrinks and the
  section keeps its full name; no crop.
- axe finds no violation on any story.

## Decisions

- **HA-D1 · Category tabs browse; they don't send.** A tab changes only what the grid shows
  (an app-only viewed category). Changing the type stops an Echo or an arpeggio at once
  (app-api.md), so a tab that picked a type would cut the music while the player looks around.
  The viewed category snaps to the selected type's whenever `mode`, `harmonyType` or
  `arpPattern` changes (the index fields, HA-D23; a change of `arpPattern` while `mode` is
  `harmony` snaps too, harmlessly, to the Harmony list), so the hardware's and a rack's
  changes always show their block. Clicking the selected item or the chosen tab sends nothing.
- **HA-D2 · Grouping and names.** The three Harmony tabs are fixed (Harmony, Echo, Multi
  Assign), as the board draws them. The API gives Multi Assign the category "Harmony", so the
  page groups it by name; a category of its own in `harmonyTypes` is a suggested follow-up
  (Contract changes 2). The arpeggio tabs come from `arpPatterns` and read the categories as
  the state spells them ("Up & Down", "As Played", "Chord Stab", "Broken Chord"), not the board's
  compressed "UpDown", "AsPlayed", "ChordStab", "BrokenChord": the state's words are what the
  Launchkey display and the drawer show today, and they fit (about 880px of 975 at 10px padding,
  which every tab in the row shares).
- **HA-D3 · Header caption.** The type name stands alone for the Harmony category (the board);
  an Echo type adds "Echo" and an arpeggio "Arpeggio · {category}" (the Harmony-Arp board), so
  the player sees which list the type belongs to when its name doesn't say.
- **HA-D4 · The switch lamp.** Label "On" / "Off" by state (the board draws "On" while on),
  with the code "Fader button 5" so the hardware button is named where the switch is. Its
  `aria-label` names the function ("Harmony/Arpeggio on (fader button 5)").
- **HA-D5 · Empty grid cells.** The board closes its grid with a blank button ("No type");
  the spec leaves cells past the last item empty and not focusable.
- **HA-D6 · Lamp size.** The board's 30px "Chord note only" lamp is the kit's `size sm` (28px,
  13px label); the kit has no 30px size and the 2px difference is within the screenshot budget.
- **HA-D7 · Bar sliders.** Volume and Touch limit are `role="slider"` rows with the fader's
  pointer model (Stage.md D23): relative to the press point, scaled by the bar's width, sends
  at most once per frame and on release when the value changed since the last send; wheel,
  arrows, PageUp/PageDown and double-click reset as the kit's faders and knobs. The row shows
  and steps from `shown = pending ?? state`: `pending` is the last value the row sent, cleared
  as soon as the state's value changes (no timer), so a drag draws its own value before the
  state echoes it and two quick ArrowUps send 101 then 102. The board draws the rows as
  readouts with a slider role and no drag maths.
- **HA-D8 · "Knob n".** Volume's second line names the Rack-page knob the live rack's map puts
  on `harmonyVolume` (knob 5 by default), from `liveRack.controls.knobs`; a map without one
  shows no line, rather than a knob that doesn't exist.
- **HA-D9 · Echo settings.** The board says Echo, Tremolo and Trill "add Speed" without drawing
  it: Speed is a 36px ChoiceRow of six tabs between Volume and Touch limit, and Chord note only
  is dropped for the Echo category (it applies to the Harmony category only, docs/harmony.md),
  so the column stays 160px.
- **HA-D10 · Multi Assign.** No settings (RM p.46): one hairline-topped row of muted text says
  so, so the column isn't blank.
- **HA-D11 · No step buttons.** The drawer's ◀ ▶ (`stepHarmonyArpType`) go: on the page every
  type is one click, and the hardware has no type control, so parity needs nothing. Shift+L
  keeps stepping the type and Shift+J the switch (the `L` and `J` entries in `keys.ts`;
  lowercase `l` is Left on/off), and `*` Arpeggio Hold.
- **HA-D12 · Compact block rules** (Kit additions): the run dot follows the Stage's run state
  (solid running, hollow sync start, hidden stopped with its space kept); the section is
  `transport.section` in its hue while running and `Main {A+main}` in `--m` stopped (Stage.md
  D4); the chord fits by the Stage's rule scaled to 48px (floor 32px, never above 48); the tones are the
  Stage's note names without intervals.
- **HA-D13 · Page app bar.** The rack readout is one line ("Rack A1 Sunday drive ●") reading
  the Stage's RackReadout fields; the One Touch group is the Stage's (D16, D17: applies at once,
  Launchkey Racks page pads 1–4; the board's "Shift + pads 9–12" is wrong).
- **HA-D14 · A chosen part tab is white.** R1–R3 in Assign wear the chosen face (white block,
  `--g` label) when chosen, like every chosen thing; the hue shows while unchosen. A hue-filled
  block would be a fifth face.
- **HA-D15 · The arpeggio kind is #527's.** The settings column is a `kind` switch (`harmony`,
  `echo`, `multi`, `arpeggio`) and the grid, tabs and header are kind-agnostic, so the
  Harmony-Arp spec adds only the `arpeggio` kind's rows (Quantize, Velocity, Hold, Keep Key On)
  and the grid area's extra rows. Until it lands, an arpeggio shows Assign (no Multi) and
  Volume, which both apply to it today, the grid lists its patterns, and a More row opens
  today's drawer (the kit's interim rule, Stage.md D32: today's equivalent exists), so
  Quantize, Hold, Velocity and Keep Key On stay reachable from the screen. The drawer is
  removed with #527.
- **HA-D16 · Bar fill.** `value / 127` for both bars, one decimal place, so a Touch limit of 1
  shows a hairline of fill (the board's 1%) and the two bars share one rule.
- **HA-D17 · Fixture.** The board is the Stage's moment with Harmony on: the fixture is the
  Stage's `boardState` with `harmonyArp`, the library lists and the default rack map replaced,
  so the two boards' shared pixels come from one source.
- **HA-D18 · Hover, cursor, focus, tab order:** the kit's (Stage.md D35, D36); the sliders use
  `ew-resize` while dragging, the horizontal twin of the faders' `ns-resize`.
- **HA-D19 · Tooltips.** Two new keys: `harmony.category` for both tab groups and
  `harmony.more` for the interim More row; the existing `harmony.*` keys cover the rest. The compact block carries the Stage's keys (`browser.open`,
  `display.tempo`, `display.chord`); the rack readout `stage.rack_name`; One Touch `ots.1`–`ots.4`.
- **HA-D20 · Library not loaded, and unknown categories.** Fixed Harmony tabs, no arpeggio
  tabs, an empty grid, and the header's name from state ("—" when the state's `typeName` is
  empty); nothing is disabled, so the page needs no loading face. A `harmonyArp.category` the
  page doesn't know (empty, or one a newer engine adds) counts as "Harmony": the Harmony tab
  and the `harmony` kind, the fullest set of settings.
- **HA-D21 · No display border.** This page's display box has no 1px border (the Channel-style
  pages don't; the Stage's does, Stage.md D42), so its content box is `48,128 1344×268`, 1px
  off the Stage's display content. The boxes above are the board's.
- **HA-D22 · Grid overflow.** Twenty cells fit; a list longer than that is clipped. Today's
  longest is 19 (Harmony); a scrolling grid is a follow-up if a library ever grows past 20 in
  one category.
- **HA-D23 · Identity by index.** The selected type is the list entry at the state's index
  (`harmonyType` or `arpPattern` by `mode`); the kind, header caption and tab snapping read
  `typeName` and `category`, which the engine sets from that same index. Tests set all of
  them together.
- **HA-D24 · Leaving the page.** The Harm/Arp tab and Alt+H (the `nav.ts` entry) on this
  page: when nothing is open over it, return to the Stage (`ui.page` `stage`), as the drawer
  toggled closed; when something is open over it, they close it and the page stays (the kit's
  "entering a page closes every drawer first" wins: the tab wasn't drawn chosen, so pressing
  it shows the page). "Open over it" is: any `NAV` entry other than the page's own whose
  `open()` is true (the drawers, the Styles browser, the Library), `ui.harmony` (today's
  drawer, which the More row opens and which has no entry once the tab's entry moves to
  `ui.page`), `ui.mixer`, or the Channel interim (`channelNav.open`). One function,
  `enterHarmArp()` in `app/src/pages/harmArp.ts` (the edits table), holds the rule; the `NAV`
  entry's `toggle()` (Alt+H) and the wiring's `onpage('harmArp')` both call it, so from the
  Library view too, Alt+H closes the Library (`ui.view = 'stage'`) and shows the page. Escape
  runs `ui.escape()` (`app/src/lib/store.svelte.ts`: drawers and overlays close first); when
  nothing was open it sets `ui.page` to `stage`, the way it sends Library back to the Stage
  today, except that the Channel interim counts as open: the `ui.page` branch returns to the
  Stage only when `channelNav.open` is false as well (today `App.svelte` runs
  `channelNav.escape()` only after `ui.escape()` returned false, so the branch must check it
  first). The `ui.page` branch is added to `ui.escape()` by the Stage lane's D2 work or here,
  whichever lands first;
  the page component itself listens to no keys (Escape reaches `ui.escape()` through
  `lib/shortcuts.ts`, as today). The other tabs switch pages as the kit says.
- **HA-D25 · Interface and files.** The page's props carry every app-only value its parts
  read (`shift`, `keyRange`, `help`, `open`, `viewed`) and a callback per non-command effect,
  so `Harmony` stays pure and a story can show any state. The lane owns the new component
  folders and the wiring; its edits to shared files are the smallest additions, listed under
  Components, and are made after the Stage lane lands.
- **HA-D26 · Slider release.** On pointerup the row cancels any frame-scheduled send and sends
  the current value once if it differs from the last value sent, so a drag never sends a
  value twice and never loses its last value (Stage.md D23's "always the last value" read as
  "the last value, once").
- **HA-D27 · Chosen is the state's.** A tab "sends nothing when chosen" means the state's value
  equals the tab's; a tab drawn chosen for another value (the arpeggio kind's Auto while
  `assign` is `multi`) still sends on click.
- **HA-D28 · Categories the page doesn't know.** A `harmonyTypes` entry whose category is
  neither "Harmony" nor "Echo" lists under the Harmony tab (as HA-D20 treats an unknown state
  category); an `arpPatterns` entry with an empty category lists under a last tab "Other".

## Kit additions

Parts this page needs that more than one board draws, written here in full because kit.md is
owned by the Stage lane (#537) and the Channel spec (#501, which kit.md names as the owner of the
page variant and the compact block) isn't written yet. The kit's owner moves them into kit.md
unchanged; until then this section is their definition.

### App bar, page variant

The kit's App bar (kit › App bar) with two parts added after the wordmark, because a page
replaces the Stage display that carries them (`Channel-Dark.dc.html` lines 77–101 are the
source; this board's 52–81 copy it). Every non-Stage display page and the tall pages use it.

- **Rack readout** (`RackReadout` `variant inline`), `margin-left: 16px` on top of the bar's
  gap 8 (so 24px after the wordmark: the wordmark is 59px wide at 18 / 500, and the readout
  starts at x = 24 + 59 + 24 = 107), a text button 32 tall, items on the baseline, gap 6, 14 /
  400, no wrap: "Rack" `--m`, then the slot `--t`
  (the bank letter and button number, Stage.md › Sounds row: "A1"; absent when no
  `quickRacks.buttons` entry is `loaded`, Stage.md D21), then `liveRack.name` `--t`, then a 5px
  round `--t` dot (`align-self: center`) when `liveRack.modified`. Click: opens the Rack page
  (Stage.md D32 interim: the Rack drawer). Tooltip `stage.rack_name`. `aria-label` "Rack:
  {name}{, modified}{, on Quick Rack A1}. Opens the Rack page". No ellipsis (the name has room
  here; a 60-character name pushes the tabs, which is a follow-up).
- **One Touch**, `margin-left: 12px` on top of the gap 8 (20px after the readout; its x
  depends on the rack name's width, as on the board), the Stage's group (Stage.md › Style
  line, One Touch):
  "One Touch" 14 `--m` with 4px right margin, four 32 × 32 buttons, gap 4, chosen = applied,
  disabled past `ots.settings.length`, `recallOts { index }` at once (D17), tooltips
  `ots.1`–`ots.4`, `aria-label`s as the Stage's.
- The page tabs, right area, Launchkey status and health slot are the kit's, unchanged; the
  active tab is the page's own (`aria-current="page"`). Tabs whose page isn't built yet keep
  the kit's interim rule from here too: such a tab opens its drawer over this page, `ui.page`
  stays `harmArp`, and while the drawer is open that tab is the chosen one and the page's tab
  is not (one chosen tab at a time; kit › App bar, "Tabs before their page exists"; the page
  reads this from its `open` prop). Entering a page (its tab or its Alt key, from anywhere)
  closes every drawer first: on this page, pressing the Harm/Arp tab while a drawer is open
  closes the drawer and keeps the page (HA-D24).

### Compact now-playing block

`CompactNowPlaying`, 320 × 84, drawn at the top-left of a page's content box on every page
that replaces the display (`Channel-Dark.dc.html` lines 142–153 are the source; this board's
117–128 copy it). A `role="group"` `aria-label` "Now playing: {style name}, {tempo} BPM,
{running | sync start | stopped}, {chord {name} | no chord}, {section as shown}" ("Now
playing: Sunday Drive Pop, 104 BPM, running, chord Am7, Main B"; stopped with no chord: "Now
playing: Sunday Drive Pop, 104 BPM, stopped, no chord, Main B"). A column: a 16px row, 12px
gap, a 48px row; the 8px left at the bottom of the 84 is empty (the box is the board's; the
content is 76).

**Row 1** (16 tall, items centred, gap 8, no wrap):

| Control | Face | Reads | Sends / does | Tooltip |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Style name | AccentBlock `size sm` (Components 3) as a text button: padding 0 6, 13 / 500, line-height 16, `--g` on `--a`, radius 0 (as the Stage's style name), `min-width: 0`, ellipsis; `aria-label` "{name}: open the Browser" | `style.name` (never empty: the engine always has a style loaded; an empty string shows "—") | opens the Browser (`ui.browser = true`, Stage.md D3) | `browser.open` |
| Tempo | `margin-left: auto`; the number 18 / 300, line-height 16, `--t`, then "BPM" 12 / 400 `--m` with 3px left margin, the two on one baseline (`align-items: baseline` inside the item); not a control | `transport.tempo` rounded (`Math.round`) | — | `display.tempo` |
| Run dot | a 6px (`--dot`) round `<span>` of the block's own, not the Stage's StatusDot (which has no `data-state` or hidden state): `transport.running` → `--ok` with `--bg` (`data-state="running"`); stopped with `transport.syncStart` → a hollow 1px `--ok` ring (`sync`); stopped → `visibility: hidden`, space kept (`stopped`); `role="img"` `aria-label` "Running" / "Sync start" / "Stopped" | `transport.running`, `transport.syncStart` | — | — |

**Row 2** (48 tall, items on the baseline, gap 14, no wrap):

- **Chord** (`ChordReadout` `size compact`, `flex: none`): the two runs only (no label, no
  tone columns, no fingering line: those are the Stage's `display` size). `chord.name` at 48 /
  300 (`--text-48`), line-height 48, letter-spacing `--ls-chord` (−2px), `--a`, `text-shadow:
  var(--ba)`, in the Stage's two runs (Stage.md D30, `splitChord`: the extension at weight 200,
  letter-spacing 0). No chord: "—" in `--d`, no shadow. **Fit:** the readout takes a `space`
  prop (px) and draws the name at `compactChordSize(width, space, base = 48)` = `min(base,
  max(32, floor(base × space / width)))` px, `width` its own `scrollWidth` at `base` px
  (measured in a hidden copy at `base`, so the measurement doesn't depend on the current
  size), re-measured after each change of `chord.name`; `base` is `--text-48` read with
  `getComputedStyle` at mount (48 when it doesn't parse, as in jsdom); letter-spacing scales
  (−2 × size / 48). `CompactNowPlaying` computes `space` = 320 − 14 − the tones' natural width
  (`scrollWidth`, not the ellipsized width) − 14 − the section's width, or with no chord (no
  tones element) 320 − 14 − the section's width, re-reading the widths after each change of
  `chord.name`, `keyboard.chordTones`, `chord.transposeKeyboard`, `transport.section`,
  `transport.main` or `transport.running`. The pure function is in
  `app/src/ui/ChordReadout/fit.ts` (Check 18). Tooltip
  `display.chord`.
- **Tones** (`flex: 0 1 auto`, see below): the note names of the Stage's tones (Stage.md › Chord: `keyboard.chordTones`
  moved by `chord.transposeKeyboard`, root first, at most six, the Stage's spelling), joined
  by spaces, 14 / 300, letter-spacing `--ls-tones` (3px), `--t2`, no intervals ("A C E G").
  No chord: absent.
- **Section** (`margin-left: auto`, `flex: none`): 24 / 300 (`--text-24`), line-height 48,
  letter-spacing `--ls-section` (−0.5px). Running: `transport.section` in the Genos spelling (kit › Section names) in its hue
  (`data-hue`), no glow. Stopped: `Main {A + transport.main}` in `--m` (Stage.md D4,
  `data-hue="m"`). Not a control.
- **When it still doesn't fit** (the chord at its 32px floor, six tones and a long section
  can pass 320px): the row is `overflow: hidden` and the tones give way: the tones element
  gets `min-width: 0; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis` and is the only item that
  shrinks (`flex: 0 1 auto`); the chord and the section keep their full width.

The block is not focusable except its style name. Light: `--ba` is `none`; nothing else changes.

### ChosenTabs, size `row`

A third size of the kit's ChosenTabs (Stage.md component 4: `page` 36 tall with a 24px bottom
block, `header` 35 with 22): **`row`**, 32 tall, 13 / 400, padding 0 10 (callers may pass 0 8),
tabs touching (gap 0), the chosen face as a 24px block centred vertically (`background:
linear-gradient(var(--t), var(--t)) center / 100% 24px no-repeat`, `--g` text, weight 400 in
both `row` sizes whatever the caller's `weight`, `data-face="chosen"`), unchosen `--m` text on nothing (or a caller's
hue and weight, with `data-hue`, dropped while chosen). A fourth, **`row-sm`**, is 28 tall
with a 22px block, 13px, padding 0 8 (the Speed tabs). Each tab is a button with
`aria-pressed`, `aria-label` its text plus ", chosen" when chosen; a click on the chosen tab
calls nothing; the group is a `role="group"` with its label. Used by the category tabs, Assign
and Speed here, and by the Settings pages' choices (#528–#533).

**Interface** (what this page needs of the Stage's component; if the Stage lane's props are
named differently, this lane maps to them, the behaviour is the spec): `size` (`page` /
`header` / `row` / `row-sm`), `label` (the group's `aria-label`), `tabs: { id: string, text:
string, name?: string, hue?: 'r1' | 'r2' | 'r3' | …, weight?: 400 | 500, pad?: 8 | 10, tip:
TipKey }[]`, `chosen: string | null` (the id that is inert and, unless `drawn` is given, wears
the face), `drawn?: string` (the id that wears the chosen face when it isn't `chosen`,
HA-D27), `mask?: string` (a `data-shot-mask` on the group), `onchoose(id)`. A tab's
`aria-label` is `name` when given (the category tabs' "{name}: {n} types…" and Assign's
"Right 1") and otherwise `text`, in both cases plus ", chosen" while it wears the face.
`aria-pressed` and `data-face` follow the face (so a `drawn` tab reads pressed); only
inertness follows `chosen`. `hue` sets `data-hue` and the unchosen colour, `weight` the
unchosen weight; both are dropped while the tab wears the face, which is always weight 400 in
the `row` sizes (the `page` and `header` sizes keep whatever weight the kit gives them; this
page doesn't change it).

### Settings rows

Three row shapes for a settings column; each is `border-top: 1px solid var(--line)`
(border-box), items centred, gap 12, no wrap. ChoiceRow and BarRow start with a 64px label
cell (`flex: none`, 13 / 400 `--m`, optionally a second line 12 / 400 `--d`, line-heights 16
and 14, gap 1); SettingsLampRow has none:

| Row | Height | Content after the label |
|---|---|---|
| ChoiceRow | 44 (or 36 with `row-sm` tabs) | a ChosenTabs `row` group |
| BarRow | 44 or 36 | a 2px bar (`flex: 1`, `--past` track, `--t2` fill from the left, `width: value / max × 100%` to one decimal) then the value, 44 wide, right-aligned, 22 / 300, line-height 24, `--t`; the row is one `<div role="slider" tabindex="0">` named by `aria-label` (Settings column › BarRow drawing gives the pointer and key maths) |
| SettingsLampRow | 36 | one or more LampButton `size sm`, gap 8, left-aligned, no label cell |

A row of plain text (this page's Note) or a single text button (its More row) is the
column's own markup: hairline top, no label cell, content at the left edge, centred
vertically.

Pure maths in `app/src/ui/BarRow/bar.ts`: `fillPercent(value, max)` → a CSS percentage string
with one decimal; `dragValue(v0, x0, x, w, min, max)` → `clamp(round(v0 + (x − x0) × 127 / w),
min, max)`: the scale is 127 per `w` px for both the 0–127 and the 1–127 range (so
`dragValue(100, 0, 24, 239, 0, 127)` is 113 and `dragValue(1, 0, −50, 239, 1, 127)` is 1).

### Tokens to add (`app/src/ui/tokens/scale.css`; the same in both themes)

Storybook axiom 2: no literal sizes in components. The values above that the scale lacks:

| Token | Value | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `--text-24` | 24px | the compact block's section |
| `--text-48` | 48px | the compact chord (its fitted size is a computed inline `font-size`, derived from this token's value) |
| `--ls-chord` | −2px | the compact chord (scaled with the fit) |
| `--ls-tones` | 3px | the compact tones |
| `--ls-section` | −0.5px | the compact section (the kit's tempo uses the same value; the Stage lane may name it first) |
| `--label-cell` | 64px | the settings rows' label cell |
| `--value-cell` | 44px | the BarRow value |
| `--bar-height` | 2px | the BarRow track and fill |
| `--dot-sm` | 5px | the rack readout's modified dot |
| `--dot` | 6px | the run dot (if the Stage lane hasn't named the status dot's size) |
| `--row-height` | 44px | ChoiceRow and BarRow at 44 |
| `--row-height-sm` | 36px | the 36px rows |
| `--chosen-block`, `--chosen-block-sm` | 24px, 22px | the `row` / `row-sm` chosen blocks (the same values as the kit's `page` / `header` sizes; if the Stage lane has named them, use its names) |
| `--lh-14`, `--lh-16`, `--lh-24`, `--lh-48` | 14px, 16px, 24px, 48px | the line-heights above |
| `--space-1`, `--space-3` | 1px, 3px | the label's two-line gap; the "BPM" margin |

Sizes the scale already has: 11–22 (`--text-*`), 32 (`--control-height`), 28
(`--control-height-compact`), 2–24 (`--space-*`), 1 (`--line-width`), 2 (`--focus-offset`;
the grid items' `outline-offset: -2px` is `calc(-1 * var(--focus-offset))`).

## Follow-ups

- Multi Assign as its own category in `harmonyTypes` (Contract changes 2), then HA-D2's
  name test goes.
- Drop the drawer and its unused tooltip keys (`harmony.mode_*`, `harmony.prev_type`,
  `harmony.next_type`, `harmony.close`) once every display page has landed.
- A scrolling or paged type grid if a category ever has more than 20 entries (HA-D22).
- The page app bar with a very long rack name (no ellipsis today).
- The Live Control percentages (ArpVel, ArpGateT, ArpUnitM; docs/arpeggio.md "Not done yet")
  have no control anywhere; a follow-up with the Harmony-Arp spec.
- A Launchkey control for the type (step with Shift + something) if players ask; today the
  hardware has only the switch and the volume knob.

# Effects

The effects buses: the send list on the left, the open bus's editor on the right, and the
switches that shape the whole mix (the style's inserts, the Master Compressor and EQ) in the
header. A display page: the band and the keys stay below it, as on the Stage.

- **Issue:** #502 · **Flow:** Shape the mix · **Boards:** `docs/design/push/Effects-Dark.dc.html`,
  `Effects-Light.dc.html`; pictures `docs/design/push/png/Effects-Dark.png`, `Effects-Light.png`
  (1440 × 900). The spec stands without them: every value a builder needs is below, in
  [Stage.md](Stage.md) or in [kit.md](kit.md); the board lines in the Components table are for
  cutting crops (the light board's lines are the dark board's minus 16, throughout).
- **Built from:** [kit.md](kit.md): App bar, Section row, Full band, Key strip, Status line, the
  faces and tokens; plus the parts under "Kit additions" at the end of this file (the page
  variant of the app bar, the compact now-playing block, Segment, Picker, Readout, Badge), which
  belong in kit.md and are written here only because this lane owns one file. This file binds
  them to the Effects page and specifies the display, which is the page's own.
- **Copied from:** Stage (#500). The app bar (page variant), section row, band, status line and
  keys are the Stage's; only the display differs. Everything the Stage spec decides (D1 scaling,
  D23 fader drag, D32 interim links, D35 hover, D36 keys, D41 test hooks, D46 wiring) holds here.
- **Variants of this screen** (they spec only what differs, against the regions named below):
  Effects-Master (#519: the Master row and the Master editor in the Open bus region),
  Effects-Reverb (#520: send 1 open, its editor), Effects-Chorus (#521: send 2 open, five sends in
  the Send list, its editor). The Send list and the Open bus are separate components with their
  own boxes so a variant replaces one without touching the other.
- **Glance order** (brightest to quietest): the compact block's chord (48px, `--a`, its glow), the
  open bus's name in the editor's title row (18 / 500 `--t`) and its white row in the list, the
  return and readout values (18 / 300 `--a`), the lamps that are on. The display's only glow is
  the chord's; the band and app bar keep the kit's (status dots, Start / Stop, fader fills).
- **Before building:** FXC1 (tooltips) must land first; nothing else blocks (see Contract changes
  needed). The Stage's C5 and the kit's new tokens are assumed landed (the Stage builds first).

## Layout

At 1440 × 900, laid out and scaled as the Stage (Stage.md D1). Padding 24 all round; a column.

| Region | Box | What's in it | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| App bar | `24,24 1392×36` | wordmark, rack readout, One Touch, page tabs (Effects chosen), Launchkey status, health slot | kit › App bar, plus Kit additions › Page app bar |
| Section row | `24,68 1392×32` | Accomp, count row, Metronome ▾, Unison, Panic, ? | kit › Section row |
| Display | `24,112 1392×300` | the compact now-playing block, a hairline, the Effects zone | below |
| Band | `24,432 1392×368` | faders, knobs, pads, transport and tempo | kit › Full band |
| Status line | `24,800 1392×20` | `state.message` | kit › Status line (Stage.md D15) |
| Keys | `24,820 1392×56` | the key strip, 61 keys | kit › Key strip |

Vertical rhythm: app bar, 8, section row, 12, display, 20, band, 20 (the status line), keys. The
board draws no status line; it is the kit's, empty when `message` is null (FX-D26).

## Display

`24,112 1392×300`, no surface, no art: ground only (`--g`), `position: relative`, `overflow:
hidden`, and the 1px transparent border the Stage keeps (Stage.md D42). Inside the border the box
is `25,113 1390×298`; the content box is `49,129 1342×266` (24 left and right, 16 top and bottom
inside the border), one row, gap 24, no wrap:

| Part | Box | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| Now playing column | `49,129 320×266`; the compact block fills `49,129 320×84`, the 182px below it is air (nothing drawn) | Kit additions › Compact block |
| Hairline | `393,129 1×266`, `--line`, `aria-hidden` | — |
| Effects zone | `418,129 973×266`: a column, header 36, gap 12, body 218 | below |

The Effects zone is `role="region"` `aria-label="Effects"`. Its body is one row, gap 24: the
**Send list** `418,177 260×218` and the **Open bus** `702,177 689×218`.

**Which bus is shown** (`shownBus(bus, rows, masterBuilt)`, pure, in
`app/src/ui/Effects/shownBus.ts`; FX-D2, FX-D23): `bus` is `ui.effectsBus`, `rows` the number of
send rows the list draws (`effects.sends.length`, or 3 when the rows come from the blocks,
FX-D3), `masterBuilt` whether the Master editor exists (#519). It returns `bus` when it is an
index below `rows`; `'master'` when `bus` is `'master'` and `masterBuilt`; otherwise 0. The
list's chosen row and the editor always agree: both are `shownBus`. So after Add send sets
`ui.effectsBus` to the new index, row 1 stays chosen until the new send arrives; if the add is
refused (`message` says so) it stays on send 1 until a send with that index exists or another
row is clicked.

**Props and callbacks.** Components take state slices as props and report through callbacks;
none reads `app.state`, `ui` or calls `app.send`. The page component `Effects` takes everything
the `Stage` page takes (the same set, so the shared regions are the same code: `state`
(`AppState`), `now`, `receivedMs`, `meterHolds`, `shift` (`ui.shift`), `keyRange`
(`ui.keyRange`), `help` (`tips.help`), `dropouts` (the `DropoutWatch` reading), and the openers
`onchannel(part)`, `onrack()`, `onbrowser()`, `onsound(part)`, `onsettings(tab)`, `onhelp()`,
`onpage(page)`), plus `effectsBus` (`ui.effectsBus`), `masterBuilt` (a constant in the wiring,
`MASTER_BUS_BUILT`, false until #519) and `onopen(bus: number | 'master')`. `send(cmd: AppCmd)`
is the one command callback. On this page the master strip's name calls `onopen('master')` and
the Multi Pad strip's name `onpage('multiPads')`, as Stage.md D32 lists them. The
sub-components below take the slice they draw (named in each section) and the callbacks they
need, passed down. The checks drive the page with a fake `send` and fake openers.

### Effects header

`418,129 973×36`, `box-sizing: border-box`, `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line)`, items
centred, gap 12, no wrap. The first two items are text; the rest sit at the right
(`margin-left: auto` on the first lamp).

| Item | Face | Reads | Sends / does | Tooltip | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| "Effects" | 14 / 400 `--m`; not a control | — | — | — | — |
| "Sends" | 14 / 400 `--t`; not a control | fixed text while a send is open (FX-D24; #519 says what it reads with Master open) | — | — | — |
| Style inserts | LampButton `size md` (32 tall, padding 0 16, 14px), label "Style inserts", no code | on = `effects.insertsOn` | `setInsertsOn { on: !insertsOn }` | `fx.inserts` | — |
| Parts | text button, 14 / 400 `--m`, 32 tall, padding 0 | — | `onchannel(4 + effects.inserts[0].part)`: Channel for the first Style part that has an insert (FX-D12; until #501, `onparts()`: today's Effects drawer at its Inserts card); disabled (`--d`, `aria-disabled`) when `effects.inserts` is empty | `fx.insert_parts` (new) | — |
| Rotary fast | LampButton `size md`, label "Rotary fast" | on = `effects.rotaryFast` | `toggleRotaryFast` (FX-D13); always enabled (a setting: it applies whenever a rotary insert plays) | `fx.rotary_fast` | Shift + encoder page ▲ |
| separator | 1 × 16 `--line`, `aria-hidden` | — | — | — | — |
| Master comp | LampButton `size md`, label "Master comp" | on = `effects.master.compressor.on` | `setMasterCompressorOn { on: !on }` | `fx.master_comp` | — |
| Comp type | text button, 14 / 300 `--a`, 32 tall, padding 0 | the name of `effects.master.compressor.preset` (`natural` "Natural", `rich` "Rich", `punchy` "Punchy", `electronic` "Electronic", `loud` "Loud"); when `compressor.edited`, a 5px round `--t` dot follows (gap 4, centred) | `onopen('master')` (spec #519); until #519 lands, `aria-disabled` with the default cursor, and the text keeps `--a` (FX-D15) | `fx.master_comp_type` | — |
| Master EQ | LampButton `size md`, label "Master EQ" | on = `effects.master.eq.on` | `setMasterEqOn { on: !on }` | `fx.master_eq` | — |
| EQ type | text button, 14 / 300 `--a`, 32 tall, padding 0 | the name of `effects.master.eq.preset` (`flat` "Flat", `mellow` "Mellow", `bright` "Bright", `loudness` "Loudness", `powerful` "Powerful"), nothing else (the board's "8 bands" is not drawn, FX-D14; the button carries `data-shot-mask="eq-type"`); the edited dot as the comp type's when `eq.edited` | as Comp type | `fx.master_eq_type` | — |

`aria-label`s: Style inserts "Style insertion effects: all on" / "all off"; Parts "Style inserts
per part: on/off and amount. Opens Channel for {`inserts[0].partName`}" ("Style inserts per
part: no part has an insert" when disabled); Rotary fast "Rotary fast, on" / "Rotary fast, off"; Master comp
"Master compressor on" / "off"; Comp type "Master compressor type: {Name}{, edited}. Opens the
Master bus"; Master EQ "Master EQ on" / "off"; EQ type "Master EQ type: {Name}{, edited}. Opens
the Master bus". `effects.master` absent (an older state from the Rust side; `types.ts`
declares it required, so the test casts): both lamps off (a click sends `{ on: true }`), the
type buttons read "Natural" and "Flat".

### Send list

`418,177 260×218`, a `nav` `aria-label="Send effects"`, a column. Below its last row the rest is
air.

- **Header** `418,177 260×20`: `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line)` (box-sizing border-box),
  a row, items on the baseline: "Send effects" 14 / 400 `--m`, line-height 18; right-aligned
  (`margin-left: auto`) "Return" 12 / 400 `--m`, line-height 18. Not a control.
- **Rows**, one per send, in `effects.sends` order (send 1 first). Each row is a `<button>` of
  the list's width, **40 tall** while the list has at most four rows; **32 tall** with five or six
  (the Add send row and a Master row don't count; FX-D7). The `nav` carries `data-rows="40"` or
  `"32"`. `box-sizing: border-box`, padding 0 10, no border except `border-bottom: 1px solid
  var(--line)`, radius 0, a grid `14px minmax(0, 1fr) auto`, items centred, column-gap 10, text
  left. Column 2 is a column of two lines, no gap (16 + 14 = 30 tall, centred: 4.5px above and
  below at 40, 0.5 at 32). Its parts:

  | Part | Drawing | Reads |
  |---|---|---|
  | Numeral | JetBrains Mono 11, `--d` | `send + 1` |
  | Name | 14 / 400, line-height 16, `--t`, no wrap | sends 1–3: the bus name "Reverb", "Chorus", "Delay" (FX-D4); 4–6: `name` (the kind's name, "Phaser") |
  | Subtitle | 12 / 400, line-height 14, `--m`, no wrap, ellipsis | sends 1–3: "{type} · {source}": `type` is `typeLabel(effectName)` (FX-D8: "Hall", "Celeste", "1/8"); `source` is "Mine" when the block's `followStyle` is false, else "From style". Sends 4–6: "Added send" |
  | Right cell | items centred | a **Badge** "Set by rack" (Kit additions) when `send < 3` and `setByRack`; otherwise the return, `returnLevel` as a number, 18 / 300, line-height 20, `--a` (FX-D5) |

  The **chosen row** (`send === shownBus`) wears the chosen face: `--t` fill, name `--g` (weight
  stays 400, FX-D27), numeral `color-mix(in srgb, var(--g) 55%, transparent)`, subtitle
  `color-mix(in srgb, var(--g) 60%, transparent)`, return `--g`; the Badge keeps its own colours. `aria-current="true"` and
  `data-face="chosen"` on it; the others carry no face and no `data-face` (they draw on
  nothing). Click: `onopen(send)` (app-only; nothing is sent). `aria-label` "Send {n}, {name},
  {subtitle}, return {r}"; with the Badge, ", type set by the rack" replaces ", return {r}";
  ", open" is appended on the chosen row. Tooltip `fx.send_open` (new). Launchkey: none (the
  knob pages reach each bus's values, not the choice of which is shown).
- **Add send** `418,357 260×32` (after four 40px rows): a `<button>`, padding 0 10, no border,
  radius 0, items centred, gap 10: "+" in a 14px-wide cell, 16 / 300 `--t`; "Add send" 14 / 400
  `--t`; right-aligned "{free} free" 12 `--m`, where `free` lists the sends not there, "4, 5 and 6
  free", "5 and 6 free", "6 free". Hidden when there are six sends. Click: `send(addSend { kind:
  'hall' })` then `onopen(sends.length)` (the index the new send will have), so the new send
  opens as it arrives (FX-D6). `aria-label` "Add a send effect ({free} free)". Tooltip
  `fx.send_add`.
- **Older state** (`effects.sends` absent or empty): the list shows three rows built from
  `effects.blocks` alone (the bus names of FX-D4, `effectName`, `followStyle`, `returnLevel`; no
  Badge) and hides Add send (FX-D3).

### Open bus

`702,177 689×218`, a `section` `aria-label="{name}, send {n}"`, a column: the **title row** (32),
10, the **readout grid** (144), 12, the **note line** (16); 4px of air below. The bus shown is
`shownBus` (above): a send index 0–5 (this section), or `'master'` (spec #519). The frame below
is shared by every send; the Delay (send 3) is the instance drawn on the board. Until the Reverb
and Chorus editors (#520, #521) land, sends 1 and 2 use the **generic block editor** below (the
same frame; their specs then replace the row tables).

#### Title row

`702,177 689×32`, items centred, gap 12, no wrap.

| Item | Face | Reads | Sends / does | Tooltip |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Name | 18 / 500, line-height 24, `--t` | as the list row's name | — | — |
| "Send {n}" | 12 `--m` | `send + 1` | — | — |
| Source | a Segment (Kit additions), `role="group"` `aria-label="{name} source"`, 8px extra left margin, options "From style" (tip `fx.follow_style`) and "Mine" (tip `fx.mine`); **sends 1–3 only** | chosen = the block's `followStyle` (true: From style) | `setFollowStyle { block, on: true }` / `{ on: false }` | per option |
| separator | 1 × 16 `--line`, `aria-hidden`; sends 1–3 only | — | — | — |
| Type | "Type" 14 `--m` (4px right margin) then, **sends 1–3**, a Segment `role="group"` `aria-label="{name} type"` with one option per entry of the block's `types`, labelled per FX-D8; every option carries the block's type tip | chosen = the block's `effect` | `setEffectType { block, effect }` | `fx.reverb_type`, `fx.chorus_type`, `fx.variation_type` by block |
| Type (added send) | "Type" 14 `--m` then a Picker (Kit additions), `aria-label` "{name} type", listing `SEND_KINDS` (`app/src/panels/effects/sendKinds.ts`, 12 kinds, their names), with the send's own `kind` first (labelled by the send's `name`) when the list lacks it | value = `kind` | `setSendKind { send, kind }` | `fx.send_kind` |
| Remove (added send) | text button "Remove", 13 / 400 `--m`, 24 tall, padding 0, right-aligned (`margin-left: auto`), `aria-label` "Remove send {n}" | — | `send(removeSend { send })` then `onopen(0)` (FX-D23) | `fx.send_remove` |

`block` for sends 1–3 is `reverb`, `chorus`, `variation`. A type change makes the bus Mine on
the session's side (`setEffectType` turns `followStyle` off); the screen sends only the type and
the Segment follows the state. The board's delay type labels are "1/8", "Dotted 1/8", "1/4",
"Ping-pong".

#### Readout grid

`702,219 689×144`: `grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr))`, column-gap 24 (columns
332.5 wide: `702,219` and `1058.5,219`). Each column is a stack of 36-tall rows (box-sizing
border-box, `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line)`), four per column. Three kinds of row:

- **Switch row:** a LampButton `size md` (32 tall, FX-D17) at the left; the rest empty.
- **Readout row:** a Readout (Kit additions): label, bar, value with unit, knob code. It is the
  control for its value.
- **Part sends row:** the label "Part sends" (13 `--m`) then four text buttons (32 tall,
  padding 0, `flex: none`), gap 12, left-justified in a cell with `min-width: 0`, `overflow:
  hidden`, no wrap (184.5px wide; four three-digit values would clip the fourth, a follow-up),
  each the part's tag "R1", "R2", "R3", "L" (12 / 500 in the part hue, `data-hue="r1"`…) and
  its value (18 / 300, line-height 20, `--a`), items on the baseline, gap 4; then the code
  "K1–4" (12 `--t2`). A part that doesn't sound (`keyboardParts[i].sounding` false): tag and
  value `--d` (`data-hue="d"`). Grid `96px minmax(0, 1fr) 28px`, column-gap 12. Each button reads
  `keyboardParts[i].strip.sends[send]` (for sends 1–3 the same as the part's `reverb`, `chorus`,
  `variation`) and calls `onchannel(i)` (FX-D11; Stage.md D32 until #501). `aria-label` "{part
  name} {bus} send {v}{, part off}. Knob {i + 1}; opens Channel", where `{bus}` is "reverb",
  "chorus", "delay", or the added send's kind name in lower case ("phaser"), and an added send
  drops the knob sentence: "Right 2 delay send 16. Knob 2; opens Channel", "Right 1 phaser send
  0. Opens Channel". Tooltip `fx.part_sends` (new, one key for the four buttons); the code cell
  is empty on an added send (no knob page moves it).

**Block editor** (one component, `BlockEditor`, draws every send's grid from a row list; the
Delay table below is what it produces for send 3, and #520 / #521 refine the tables for their
buses): the **left column** holds the parameter rows, from the bus's parameters in order (sends
1–3 the block's `params`, `FxParamState`; added sends the send's `params`, `SettingState` by
index), with three rules: a 0–1 parameter is a switch row (the delay's "Tempo sync"; never the
ping-pong, next rule); the delay's Note and Time share one readout row, Note while the sync
switch is 1, Time while it is 0 (both K5); the delay's Ping-pong has no row (the type sets it).
On a block the rules key on the `param` ids (`delaySync`, `delayNote`, `delayTime`,
`pingPong`); on an added send (names only) they apply only when its `params` include "Tempo
sync", "Note", "Time" and "Ping-pong" together (a delay kind), so a reverb's "Time" is an
ordinary row. That gives at most four rows (a delay: sync, Note/Time, Feedback, Tone; a reverb:
Time, Pre-delay, Tone; a chorus: Rate, Depth; a phaser: Depth, Rate, Feedback). The **right
column** holds Return, then Band send and Pad send (**blocks only**: sends 1–3), then Part
sends. Rows not used are not drawn (the column ends early). Knob codes: sends 1–3 by the bus's
knob page (`src/knobs.rs` `KnobPage`): knobs 5–7 the parameter rows in order (the chorus has
two, so K7 is nothing), K8 Return, K1–4 the part sends; added sends: none. A kind with no
`params` (one this build doesn't know) shows Return and Part sends only. **Tooltips** by rule: a
block parameter `fx.param.<snake_case(param)>` (`reverbTime` → `fx.param.reverb_time`,
`chorusDepth` → `fx.param.chorus_depth`); a block's Return, Band send and Pad send
`fx.<reverb|chorus|variation>_return`, `_band`, `_pad`; an added send's parameters
`fx.send_param` and its Return `fx.send_return`; every Part sends button `fx.part_sends`.

The Delay editor (send 3, block `variation`), left column then right, top to bottom:

| Row | Kind | Label | Reads | Unit | Range (bar) | Code | Sends | Tooltip | Launchkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | switch | "Tempo sync" | on = `delaySync` param `value` 1 | — | — | — | `setEffectParam { block: 'variation', param: 'delaySync', value: 0 \| 1 }` | `fx.param.delay_sync` | — |
| L2 | readout | "Note" when `delaySync` is 1, else "Time" | `delayNote` (`display`: "1/16", "1/8T", "1/8", "1/4T", "1/8.", "1/4", "1/4.", "1/2") or `delayTime` (the number) | — / "ms" | 0–7 / 10–2000 | K5 | `setEffectParam` `delayNote` / `delayTime` | `fx.param.delay_note` / `fx.param.delay_time` | Delay knob page, knob 5 |
| L3 | readout | "Feedback" | `delayFeedback` | "%" | 0–90 | K6 | `setEffectParam` `delayFeedback` | `fx.param.delay_feedback` | knob 6 |
| L4 | readout | "Tone" | `delayTone` as `display` without its unit ("5.0") | "kHz" | 10–200 | K7 | `setEffectParam` `delayTone` | `fx.param.delay_tone` | knob 7 |
| R1 | readout | "Return" | the block's `returnLevel` | — | 0–127 | K8 | `setEffectReturn { block, level }` | `fx.variation_return` | knob 8 |
| R2 | readout | "Band send" | the block's `bandSend` | "%" | 0–127 | — | `setBandSend { block, level }` | `fx.variation_band` | — |
| R3 | readout | "Pad send" | the block's `padSend` | "%" | 0–127 | — | `setPadSend { block, level }` | `fx.variation_pad` | — |
| R4 | part sends | "Part sends" | `strip.sends[2]` of each keyboard part | — | — | K1–4 | `onchannel(i)` | `fx.part_sends` | knobs 1–4 |

Every parameter readout takes its `min`, `max`, `default` and `display` from its `params`
entry; the value shown is `display` with its unit split off by `splitUnit` (Kit additions:
"38%" → "38" + "%", "5.0 kHz" → "5.0" + "kHz", "375 ms" → "375" + "ms", "0.50 Hz" → "0.50" +
"Hz"; "1/8" unchanged, no unit). Return, Band send and Pad send have no `display`: they read
the number, with "%" on the two sends. A readout's `aria-valuetext` is "{label} {display}"
("Feedback 38%", "Note 1/8", "Return 36", "Band send 0%", "Pad send 20%"); the Readout part
gives the rest of its accessibility and pointer rules. The `SendState.params` of sends 1–3 (`SettingState`, no `param` id)
carry the same values as the block's `params`; the editor reads the block's (they carry the
`param` id `setEffectParam` needs).

An **added send** (4–6) follows the generic editor: its `params` as left-column rows (a Phaser:
Depth 0–127 "64", Rate 5–500 "0.50" + "Hz", Feedback 0–90 "40" + "%"), empty code cells,
sending `setSendParam { send, param: <index>, value }` (tooltip `fx.send_param`); Return
(`setSendReturn { send, level }`, tooltip `fx.send_return`) as the right column's first row and
Part sends after it; no Band send or Pad send rows (the API has them for blocks only).

#### Note line

`702,375 689×16`: a `<p>`, 12 / 400, line-height 16, `--m`, no wrap, `overflow: hidden`. Sends
1–3: "Picking a type makes it Mine. Knob page {p}/6, {Page}, moves K1 to K8." with page 4
Reverb, 5 Chorus, 6 Delay (the fixed order of `KnobPage::ALL`, `src/knobs.rs`). Added sends:
"Saved with the rack. No knob page moves it." (FX-D16). Not a control.

## Band, keys and status on the Effects page

The kit's full band, key strip and status line, unchanged: the Effects page adds nothing and
hides nothing. The fader layer and knob page are whatever the state has; the board (and the
fixture) have the Reverb layer and knob page 6 (Delay) so the band shows the same values as the
display: strips 1–4 read "Rev 40", "Rev 30", "Rev 0", "Rev 20" (kit › FaderStrip, Layers), the
master button reads "Panel ·" over "Reverb" (Kit additions › Lamp row in a layer), and knobs
1–8 read Right 1 … Left (DlyR1…DlyL), Time/Note "1/8" (DlyTime), Feedback "38" + "%" (DlyFdbk),
Tone "5.0" + "kHz" (DlyTone), Return "36" (DlyRtn): the display's Part sends and readouts show
the same values as knobs 1–4 and 5–8. Knob 7's "5.0 kHz" needs the kit's unit split extended
(Kit additions › `splitUnit`). The effect knob pages' plain names (Stage.md D6 table, extended;
FX-D20), derived from `function`, the knob's index and `name`: `partReverb` / `partChorus` /
`partDelay` → the part by knob index (knobs 1–4: "Right 1", "Right 2", "Right 3", "Left");
`delayTime` → "Time/Note"; `fxParam` → `name` with its first word removed ("Delay Feedback" →
"Feedback", "Reverb Pre-delay" → "Pre-delay", "Chorus Rate" → "Rate"); `fxReturn` → "Return".

## States

| State | What changes |
|---|---|
| Send 3 open, playing (the board) | as drawn |
| Another send open | that row chosen; the editor shows its frame: Reverb (#520), Chorus (#521), or the added send's rows above |
| Master open (`ui.effectsBus` `'master'`) | spec #519; until then `shownBus` is 0 (send 1 chosen and shown) and the two type buttons are disabled |
| Send 1 or 2 open before #520 / #521 | the generic block editor: Reverb rows Time (K5), Pre-delay (K6), Tone (K7); Chorus rows Rate (K5), Depth (K6); then Return, Band send, Pad send, Part sends |
| Added send open | no Source segment or separator; the Type is a Picker; Remove at the right; readouts per its `params`; no Band / Pad rows; note line "Saved with the rack…" |
| Tempo sync off | row L2 reads "Time", `delayTime` in ms |
| A send's type follows the style | its Source segment on From style; its subtitle "… · From style" |
| The rack keeps a send's type (`setByRack`, sends 1–3) | the Badge in place of the return in the list; the editor unchanged |
| Three sends only | Add send reads "4, 5 and 6 free" |
| Six sends | Add send hidden; rows 32 tall |
| Older state: no `effects.sends` | three block rows, Add send hidden; no `effects.master`: both master lamps off |
| Style without inserts | Parts disabled (`--d`, `aria-disabled`); Style inserts still a lamp |
| A part off (R3) | its Part sends tag and value `--d`; its strip and lamp per the kit |
| Comp or EQ edited | the edited dot after the type name |
| Stopped | compact block: run dot hidden, section in `--m` (Kit additions › Compact block); count row per Stage.md D4 |
| No chord | compact block chord "—" in `--d`, no tones |
| No Launchkey, no synth, trouble, a refusal | as the Stage (kit › App bar, Status line) |
| Fader layer Vol, another knob page | the band per the kit; the display doesn't change |

Light theme: the same markup; only tokens change. The open row is `--t` (#111) with `--g`
(#f2f1ee) text; the Badge `--past` (#c4c3bf) with `--t2`; no glow draws (every glow token is
`none` or 0% in light).

## Board fixture

The state and moment that reproduce the board, for the `Pages/Effects` › `Board` story and its
shots: `app/src/ui/Effects/Effects.fixtures.ts` exports `boardState`, `boardNow` and
`boardMeterHolds`. `boardState` is the Stage's `boardState` (`app/src/ui/Stage/Stage.fixtures.ts`)
with the fields below changed; everything not listed (the clock, transport, chord, style, OTS,
rack, pads, keys, `io`, `message`) is the Stage's, so the app bar, section row, compact block,
pads and keys are the same moment (`boardNow = 10000`, bar 3 beat 3, LED phase 0.25).

- **Props beside the state** (the fixture exports them too): `boardEffectsBus = 2` (the Delay
  open), `receivedMs = boardNow`, `shift` false, `keyRange` 61, `help` false, `dropouts` none,
  `masterBuilt` false. (`ui.*` is not in `AppState`; the story passes these as props.)
- `mixer`: faderPage "panel", **faderLayer "reverb"**, styleVolume 100, multiPadVolume 90,
  master 100.
- `surface.faders` (9): values **40, 30, 0, 20**, 100, 90, null, null, 100 (in a send layer a
  part fader's `value` is its send); labels as the Stage; fader 2 `waiting` true at `position` 50;
  `set` the matching `setPartSend { send: 'reverb' }` for 1–4.
- `keyboardParts[i].strip.sends` (sends 1–6): R1 `[40, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, R2 `[30, 10, 16, 0, 0,
  0]`, R3 `[0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, L `[20, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]`; their `reverb`, `chorus`, `variation`
  the same numbers. On, sounding, sounds and plugins as the Stage (R3 off, missing).
- `meters` as the Stage (strips 1–4 hide theirs in the layer); `boardMeterHolds` the Stage's.
- `knobs`: page "delay", pageName "Delay", pageNumber 6, pageCount 6; knobs 1–8 (function,
  name, short, value, level): partDelay "Right 1 Delay" "DlyR1" "0" 0; partDelay "Right 2 Delay"
  "DlyR2" "16" 16; partDelay "Right 3 Delay" "DlyR3" "0" 0; partDelay "Left Delay" "DlyL" "0" 0;
  delayTime "Delay Time" "DlyTime" "1/8" **36** (`floor(2 × 127 / 7)`: the engine's
  `param_reading` truncates `(v − min) × 127 / (max − min)`, FX-D19); fxParam "Delay Feedback"
  "DlyFdbk" "38%" 53 (`floor(38 × 127 / 90)`); fxParam "Delay Tone" "DlyTone" "5.0 kHz" 26
  (`floor(40 × 127 / 190)`); fxReturn "Delay Return" "DlyRtn" "36" 36.
- `effects.blocks`: reverb `hall` ("Hall"), returnLevel 64, bandSend 100, padSend 100, params
  reverbTime 24 "2.4 s", preDelay 22 "22 ms", reverbTone 45 "4.5 kHz" (defaults the same),
  styleEffect `{ name: "Real Medium Hall", effect: "hall" }`, **followStyle false**; chorus
  `celeste` ("Celeste"), returnLevel 48, bandSend 0, padSend 0, params chorusRate 29 "0.29 Hz",
  chorusDepth 9 "0.9 ms", styleEffect `{ name: "Celeste 1", effect: "celeste" }`, followStyle
  true; variation `eighth` ("Delay 1/8"), returnLevel 36, bandSend 0, padSend 20, params
  delaySync 1 "On", delayNote 2 "1/8", delayTime 375 "375 ms", delayFeedback 38 "38%", delayTone
  50 "5.0 kHz", pingPong 0 "Off" (defaults: the `eighth` type's, the same), styleEffect null,
  followStyle false. Each block's `types` as the API lists them.
- `effects.sends`: send 0 hall "Hall" returnLevel 64 fromStyle true setByRack false; send 1
  celeste "Celeste" 48, fromStyle true, **setByRack true** (a valid state: the override keeps a
  style change off the send while `followStyle` stays true; FX-D19); send 2 eighth "Delay 1/8"
  36, fromStyle true, setByRack false; send 3 phaser "Phaser" returnLevel 20, fromStyle false,
  setByRack true, params Depth 64 (0–127, default 64, "64"), Rate 50 (5–500, default 50, "0.50
  Hz"), Feedback 40 (0–90, default 40, "40%"). Sends 0–2's `params` are `SettingState` copies of
  their block's values (name, value, min, max, default, display).
- `effects.inserts`: `[{ part: 3, partName: "Chord 1", name: "British Combo Classic", effect:
  "distortion", on: true, amount: 64 }]` (the dev mock's); `insertsOn` true; `rotaryFast` false.
- `effects.master`: compressor on, preset `natural`, compression 30, texture 50, output 1, edited
  false; eq off, preset `flat`, bands `eqPresetBands('flat')`, edited false.
- `home.bandSends` levels 100, 0, 0 (reverb, chorus, delay: the blocks' band sends above).
- `surface.layer` none; lamps as the Stage.

Board texts that differ from this fixture on purpose, each masked in the screenshot check: the
count row's "fill after bar 4" (Stage.md D5, `data-shot-mask="when"`) and the header's "8 bands"
(FX-D14, `data-shot-mask="eq-type"`). Differences under the diff's threshold, not masked: the
Note readout's bar (the board drew 40%, the rule gives 2/7 = 28.6%, over a 96.5 × 2 px bar), the
Pad send bar (board 20%, rule 20 / 127 = 15.7%), knobs 5–7's arcs (board 40%, 42%, 21%;
fixture 36, 53 and 26 of 127), the Tempo sync lamp's height (board 30, kit 32, FX-D17), and the
light board's `--m` and `--lamp-ink` (Stage.md › Board fixture).

## Components

Every part of the screen, in build order; a component is built only after everything in its
"Built from" column. Numbers 0–41 are the Stage's components (Stage.md › Components), reused as
they are, with the Stage's board lines; the Effects page builds on them and adds the ones below.
Each new one gets `app/src/ui/<Name>/` with a SPEC.md per `docs/factory/spec-template.md`; its
Boards line and crops come from the board lines here (dark / light = dark − 16). "Exists" is
whether it is in `app/src/ui` today (after the Stage lane, the Stage's components exist).

| # | Component | Kind | Built from | Exists | Board lines (dark / light) | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0–41 | the Stage's | — | — | with the Stage | Stage boards | Stage.md |
| 2′ | LampButton (exists) | primitive | — | yes; this page also needs a `tip` prop (`use:tip` on the button) and `data-face="on|off|disabled|record"` (Stage.md D41: the Stage's row 2 lists neither; add both there) | Stage boards | kit › Faces |
| 12′ | Knob (the Stage's) | primitive | — | edited, not forked: the value split uses `splitUnit` and the names the FX-D20 rule | Stage boards | kit › Knob |
| 20′ | RackReadout (the Stage's) | primitive | — | edited: gains `variant="bar"`, the one-row form of Kit additions › Page app bar (the Stage's two-line column is `variant="cell"`, the default) | 73 / 57 | Kit additions › Page app bar |
| 24′ | AppBar (the Stage's) | complex | RackReadout, OneTouch | edited: gains `variant="page"` | 71–100 / 55–84 | Kit additions › Page app bar |

Props of the sub-components, for their stories: `EffectsHeader` takes `effects` (the
`EffectsState`) and `send`, `onchannel`, `onopen`, `masterBuilt`; `SendList` takes `sends`,
`blocks`, `shownBus`, `send`, `onopen`; `BusTitle` takes `send` (the `SendState`), `block` (the
`EffectBlockState` or null), `send`, `onopen`; `BlockEditor` the same plus `parts`
(`keyboardParts`) and `onchannel`; `BusEditor` takes `effects`, `parts`, `effectsBus`,
`masterBuilt`, `send`, `onopen`, `onchannel`; `CompactBlock` takes `style`, `transport`,
`chord`, `keyboard`, `onbrowser`. Story args are slices of the fixture: `Components/BusEditor ›
AddedSend` is the fixture with `effectsBus` 3; `Components/SendList › SixSends` is the fixture's
four sends plus send 4 `plate` "Plate" (return 64) and send 5 `room` "Room" (return 64), both
`setByRack` true.

Components take props and call callbacks; none reads `app.state` or sends. The page wiring
(`app/src/pages/EffectsWiring.svelte`, outside `app/src/ui`, as Stage.md D46) reads `app.state`
and `ui.effectsBus`, keeps `now`, `receivedMs` and the meter holds (shared with the Stage's
wiring: one module, `app/src/pages/clock.svelte.ts`, FX-D21), passes them down and sends
commands.

## Gap against today

| Area | In `app/src` now | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Effects screen | `panels/effects/Effects.svelte`: a drawer (`Overlay`, `ui.effects`, Alt+E) with one card per block (From style / Mine chips, type chips, `FxKnob`s for return and parameters, `Toggle`s for the switches, `HSlider`s for Band and Pads, a Rack keeps-type toggle with "Set by rack" and "Use style's"), a card per added send (a `<select>` kind, knobs, Remove), an Add send card (a kind `<select>` and Add), and an Inserts card (all on, Rotary fast, each part's switch, name and amount) | Replaced by this page (`ui.page` `effects`, FX-D1): the cards become the send list and one open editor; the knobs become Readouts; Band and Pads become readout rows; "Rack keeps type" and "Use style's" leave the screen (FX-D5: the Badge shows the state; the switch lives in the Chorus editor, #521); the per-part inserts go to Channel (FX-D12). Until #501 lands, the drawer stays, reached only from Parts for its Inserts card (FX-D12); the drawer, its tests (`Effects.test.ts`) and its tooltip keys are removed once #501 lands; `sendKinds.ts` stays (the Picker's list) |
| Master effects | `panels/mixer/MasterFx.svelte`: Comp and EQ switches on the master strip and a floating editor (`fx.master_edit`) | The header's two lamps and two type readouts; the editor becomes the Master bus (#519) |
| Navigation | `lib/nav.ts` `NAV` entry `effects` (`toggle: ui.toggleDrawer('effects')`), `nav.effects` tooltip "Opens the Effects screen… Press again to close" | The tab shows the page (kit › App bar, D2); `nav.effects` body rewritten (FXC1); Alt+E shows the page and does nothing when it is already shown (a tab, not a toggle; FX-D1). Stage.md D32's interim rows for "Effects page" and "Effects at the master" are dropped: the band sends open this page with the bus as it was, the master strip name opens it with `ui.effectsBus = 'master'` (FX-D25) |
| Channel, until #501 | `panels/channel/nav.svelte.ts` `show(part)` draws `ChannelView` in the Stage display's place | `onchannel(part)` from this page sets `ui.page = 'stage'` and calls `show(part)` (the view lives on the Stage today); once Channel is a page, `ui.page = 'channel'` with the part |
| App-only state | `ui.effects` (the drawer's switch) | `ui.effectsBus: number \| 'master'` (FX-D2), kept while the app runs, not saved |
| Controls | `lib/ui/Toggle.svelte`, `panels/mixer/FxKnob.svelte`, `panels/settings/HSlider.svelte` | Segment, Picker, Readout, Badge (Kit additions) |
| Tooltips | `fx.*` keys exist for every bus control, switch, return, band and pad send, master switch and type | New: `fx.send_open`, `fx.insert_parts`, `fx.part_sends` (FXC1) |
| Screenshot tool | `app/scripts/shots.ts` | The Stage's build-time item (per-story viewport and masks, Stage.md D39); nothing more |

## Contract changes needed

FXC1 blocks the build (as the Stage's C5: a missing `TipKey` fails `npm run check` and the
tooltip catalog test). Nothing else is needed: every command the page sends and every field it
reads exists in `docs/app-api.md` and `app/src/lib/api/types.ts`.

1. **FXC1 · Tooltips** (`app/src/help/tooltips.ts`, `app/docs/controls.md`), **lands before the
   build**. Bodies are static strings (no templating). New keys: `fx.send_open` (title "Send
   effect", body "Opens this send's editor: its type, settings, return and the parts' sends.
   Sends 1–3 are the style's reverb, chorus and delay; 4–6 are yours, saved with the rack."),
   `fx.insert_parts` (title "Parts", body "Each Style part's insertion effect, on/off and amount,
   on the part's Channel page.") and `fx.part_sends` (title "Part sends", body "Each keyboard
   part's send to this effect. Opens the part's Channel page, where it is a control; knobs 1–4 of
   the effect's knob page move them too.", launchkey "Reverb, Chorus and Delay knob pages, knobs
   1–4"); each new key has `genos` null and `keys` `[]`. Rewrites: `nav.effects` from "Opens the
   Effects screen … Press again to close" to
   "Shows the Effects page: the send effects, the open one's editor, the style's inserts and the
   master compressor and EQ"; removals, when the drawer goes after #501 (FX-D12): `drawer.effects`
   and `fx.insert_part` (the drawer's own controls), so the catalog and coverage tests list no
   control that no longer exists; `fx.send_add` gains "Adds a Hall; change its type in its editor"
   (FX-D6); `fx.rotary_fast` gains launchkey "Shift + encoder page ▲" (parity); the `launchkey`
   line of `fx.param.delay_note`, `delay_time`, `delay_feedback`, `delay_tone` and
   `variation_return` reads "Delay knob page, knob 5 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8" (the Reverb's and Chorus's
   the same way for #520 and #521), replacing the old "FX knob page" lines.

## Checks

Vitest (`npx vitest run` on the page and component tests), each against the board fixture unless
it says otherwise. They read roles, names, attributes (`data-face`, `data-hue`) and the commands
sent (a fake `send`); never computed colours or layout (Stage.md D41).

1. Header: Style inserts has `aria-pressed="true"` and `data-face="on"`; a click sends
   `setInsertsOn { on: false }`; Rotary fast sends `toggleRotaryFast`; Master comp sends
   `setMasterCompressorOn { on: false }`; Master EQ sends `setMasterEqOn { on: true }`; the comp
   type reads "Natural" and the EQ type "Flat", both `aria-disabled` (interim, FX-D15); with
   `compressor.edited` true the comp type's `aria-label` ends ", edited. Opens the Master bus";
   Parts calls `onchannel(7)`; with `inserts` empty Parts is `aria-disabled` and calls nothing;
   with `effects.master` deleted from a cast copy of the fixture both lamps are off.
2. Send list: four rows named "Reverb", "Chorus", "Delay", "Phaser" with subtitles "Hall · Mine",
   "Celeste · From style", "1/8 · Mine", "Added send"; row 3 has `aria-current="true"` and
   `data-face="chosen"`, the others no `data-face`; row 2 shows "Set by rack" and no return, and
   its `aria-label` is "Send 2, Chorus, Celeste · From style, type set by the rack"; row 4 reads
   20; a click on row 1 calls `onopen(0)` and sends nothing; Add send reads "5 and 6 free", a
   click sends `addSend { kind: 'hall' }` and calls `onopen(4)`; with `effectsBus` 4 and four
   sends, row 1 is chosen and the editor shows Reverb (`shownBus(4, 4, false)` is 0,
   `shownBus('master', 4, false)` is 0, `shownBus('master', 4, true)` is `'master'`,
   `shownBus(2, 3, false)` is 2); with six
   sends there is no Add send and the `nav` has `data-rows="32"` (`"40"` on the fixture); with
   `effects.sends` empty there are three rows and no Add send.
3. Title row: "Delay" and "Send 3"; Mine has `aria-pressed="true"`, a click on From style sends
   `setFollowStyle { block: 'variation', on: true }`; "1/8" is pressed; a click on Ping-pong sends
   `setEffectType { block: 'variation', effect: 'pingPong' }`; the type options read "1/8",
   "Dotted 1/8", "1/4", "Ping-pong" (`typeLabel(name: string)`, pure, `app/src/ui/Effects/
   typeLabel.ts`, taking the state's `name`: "Delay 1/8." → "Dotted 1/8", "Delay 1/8" → "1/8",
   "Delay 1/4" → "1/4", "Ping-Pong" → "Ping-pong", anything else unchanged: "Hall" → "Hall").
4. Readouts: Tempo sync is on and a click sends `setEffectParam { block: 'variation', param:
   'delaySync', value: 0 }`; with `delaySync` 0 row L2 reads "Time", "375", "ms" and its code is
   "K5"; Note reads "1/8", `aria-valuetext` "Note 1/8"; Feedback has `aria-valuenow` 38, min 0,
   max 90; with the bar element (`[data-part="bar"]`) stubbed to a 96px-wide
   `getBoundingClientRect`, a pointer press anywhere on the Feedback readout and a 48px move to
   the right sends `setEffectParam delayFeedback 83` (one send: the press alone sends nothing,
   FX-D9); a wheel notch up sends 39; → sends 39, End sends 90, and each key event has
   `defaultPrevented` set (the global handler never sees it); a double-click on Return sends
   `setEffectReturn { block: 'variation', level: 64 }` once (the default; the fixture's 36
   differs from it); Band send drag sends `setBandSend`; Pad send sends `setPadSend`;
   `dragValue(38, 48, 96, 0, 90)` is 83 and `fraction(2, 0, 7)` is 2/7 (pure,
   `app/src/ui/Readout/readout.ts`); `splitUnit("5.0 kHz")` is `["5.0", "kHz"]`, `splitUnit("3
   of 8")` is `["3 of 8", ""]`; the readout is a focusable element with `role="slider"` and
   `aria-label` "Feedback", not a `<button>` (jsdom has no `setPointerCapture`: the component
   guards the call).
5. Part sends: R2 reads 16 and R3 has `data-hue="d"`; a click on R1 calls `onchannel(0)`; the R2
   button's `aria-label` is "Right 2 delay send 16. Knob 2; opens Channel"; on the Phaser, R1's
   is "Right 1 phaser send 0. Opens Channel".
6. Added send open (`effectsBus` 3): no Source group; the Picker lists 12 options and a change to
   `room` sends `setSendKind { send: 3, kind: 'room' }`; Remove sends `removeSend { send: 3 }` and
   calls `onopen(0)`; readouts Depth, Rate ("0.50", "Hz"), Feedback with empty code cells; a drag
   on Depth sends `setSendParam { send: 3, param: 0, … }`; Return sends `setSendReturn`; no Band
   send or Pad send row; the note line reads "Saved with the rack. No knob page moves it."; an
   added send of kind `eighth` (six params) draws four left rows (Tempo sync, Note, Feedback,
   Tone) and no Ping-pong row.
7. Note line for send 3: "Picking a type makes it Mine. Knob page 6/6, Delay, moves K1 to K8.";
   for send 1 "… 4/6, Reverb, …"; send 1 open shows rows Time (K5), Pre-delay (K6), Tone (K7),
   Return (K8), Band send, Pad send, Part sends (the generic block editor).
8. Compact block: the style name button calls `onbrowser()`; "104" and "BPM"; the run dot's
   `aria-label` "Running"; the chord runs "Am" and "7"; tones "A C E G"; "Main B" with
   `data-hue="main"`; the group's `aria-label` is "Now playing: Sunday Drive Pop, 104 BPM,
   running, chord Am7 A C E G, Main B"; stopped: the dot `hidden`, the section `data-hue="m"`,
   the label "… stopped, …"; no chord: "—" and "… no chord, …".
9. Page app bar: the rack readout reads "Rack", "A1", "Sunday drive" with the modified dot; One
   Touch 2 is pressed; the Effects tab has `aria-current="page"`.
10. Band: strips 1–4 read "Rev 40", "Rev 30", "Rev 0", "Rev 20" and have no meter element; the
    Reverb layer tab is selected; knob 7 reads "5.0" with unit "kHz" (the unit split); knob 5's
    name is "Time/Note".
11. Every interactive element has a `data-tip` in the catalog (the existing tooltip test); From
    style carries `fx.follow_style` and Mine `fx.mine`; the four part-send buttons `fx.part_sends`.
12. Wiring (`app/src/pages/EffectsWiring.test.ts`, Stage.md D32 interim): `onchannel(7)` sets
    `ui.page` to `stage` and calls `channelNav.show(7)`; `onopen(2)` sets `ui.effectsBus` to 2;
    it passes `masterBuilt` false (`MASTER_BUS_BUILT` in the wiring), so the comp and EQ type
    buttons are `aria-disabled`; Alt+E on the page leaves `ui.page` as it is; Esc on the page
    changes nothing (FX-D28). Until #501 (FX-D12): Parts calls `onparts()`, which opens today's
    Effects drawer (`ui.effects` true) and calls `scrollIntoView` on its `[data-section="inserts"]`
    card (FX-D12), and the drawer's part
    switches still send `setPartInsertOn` / `setPartInsertAmount`.
13. Tab order (FX-D22), tested as DOM order of the focusable elements on the page: app bar,
    section row, compact block (style name), header lamps and buttons left to right, send rows
    top to bottom then Add send, the title row left to right (each Segment one tab stop), the
    left column's rows then the right column's (the four part-send buttons in part order), then
    the band.

**Story and screenshot checks** (`npm run shots -- Effects`, real Chrome), for what jsdom can't
see:

- `Pages/Effects` › `Board` (export `Board`, layout `fullscreen`, `parameters.shots = { viewport:
  { width: 1440, height: 900 }, mask: ['[data-shot-mask="when"]', '[data-shot-mask="eq-type"]']
  }`) renders `Effects` with `boardState`, `boardNow` and `boardMeterHolds`, unscaled, in both
  themes, against `app/src/ui/Effects/crops/Board-dark.png` and `Board-light.png` (copies of
  `docs/design/push/png/Effects-Dark.png` and `Effects-Light.png`): at most 0.02 of the unmasked
  pixels differ. It covers the chosen row, the lamps, the accent values, the bars, the compact
  block's glow (dark) and none (light), the layered strips and the Delay knob page.
- `Components/BusEditor` › `AddedSend` (send 3, the Phaser, open) and › `TimeNotSynced`
  (`delaySync` 0): no crop (not on a board); judged by Inspect against the rules above.
- `Components/SendList` › `SixSends` (six rows at 32px, no Add send) and › `BlocksOnly` (no
  `sends`): no crop.
- `Components/CompactBlock` › `LongName` (a 60-character style name): the name ends in an
  ellipsis inside the 16px row; the tempo and dot keep their place; no crop. › `LongChord`
  (`C#m7b5/G#`, section "Ending III"): the chord and section keep their size, the tones end in
  an ellipsis, nothing wraps.
- axe finds no violation on any story.

## Decisions

- **FX-D1 · A page, not a drawer.** Effects is `ui.page` `effects` (Stage.md D2), reached by the
  tab, Alt+E, the Stage's band sends and the master strip's name. Alt+E shows the page and does
  nothing when it is already shown (tabs don't toggle). The drawer goes.
- **FX-D2 · The open bus is app-only.** `ui.effectsBus: number | 'master'` (a send index 0–5 or
  the Master), 0 at start, kept while the app runs; nothing in the API chooses it. A row click
  sets it; Add send and Remove move it (FX-D6, FX-D23). What is drawn is `shownBus` (Display),
  so the chosen row and the editor never disagree.
- **FX-D3 · Rows from `sends`, blocks as the fallback.** The list is `effects.sends`, each row
  joined to its block (sends 1–3) for `followStyle`, `effectName`, `bandSend` and `padSend`. With
  no `sends` (an older state) the three blocks are the rows and nothing can be added.
- **FX-D4 · Names.** Sends 1–3 are named by their bus, "Reverb", "Chorus", "Delay" (not
  "Variation": the block is the tempo delay, as today's drawer titles it), the type in the
  subtitle; added sends by their kind's name.
- **FX-D5 · The Badge replaces the return.** On sends 1–3 with `setByRack`, the list shows "Set
  by rack" where the return would be (the board's choice: the return is in the editor anyway).
  Added sends are always the rack's, so they show no Badge. The override switch itself is not on
  this screen; the Chorus editor (#521) draws it as "Keep with rack".
- **FX-D6 · Add send adds a Hall and opens it.** No kind picker before adding (the board draws
  none): the new send arrives as a Hall and its editor's Picker changes the kind. The screen sets
  `ui.effectsBus` to the new index before the state arrives; until it does, the editor shows
  send 1 (FX-D23).
- **FX-D7 · Row height.** 40px with up to four rows, 32px with five or six, so six sends and the
  Add send row fit the 218px body (20 + 6 × 32 + 32 = 244 doesn't, so with six sends Add send is
  hidden anyway: 20 + 6 × 32 = 212). The Master variant (#519) adds its row at 32px with its own
  rule.
- **FX-D8 · Delay type labels.** The delay's types read "1/8", "Dotted 1/8", "1/4", "Ping-pong"
  on the Segment and in the subtitle (the state's "Delay 1/8", "Delay 1/8.", "Delay 1/4",
  "Ping-Pong" are long for a 24px segment and repeat the bus name). The reverb's and chorus's
  names are the state's.
- **FX-D9 · Readout drag.** Horizontal, relative, like a fader (Stage.md D23): the value moves by
  the pointer's travel from the press point, the bar's width standing for the whole range,
  `value = clamp(round(v0 + (x − x0) × (max − min) / width), min, max)`, `width` the bar
  element's width, the press anywhere on the readout, with pointer capture; a send goes out
  only when the whole-number value differs from the last one sent (or from `v0` at the press),
  at most once per animation frame, and the last value on release if it is still unsent; a
  press without movement sends nothing. Wheel ±1 per notch (`deltaY` < 0 or `deltaX` > 0 is +,
  one step per event whatever the delta's size; the event is `preventDefault`ed so the page
  doesn't scroll); → and ↑ +1, ← and ↓ −1, PageUp/PageDown ±10, Home `min`, End `max`; Space and
  Enter do nothing. Every key the readout handles, and Space and Enter, are `preventDefault`ed
  and `stopPropagation`ed, so the window handler (`app/src/lib/shortcuts.ts`: Space is Start /
  Stop, Enter the Browser, PageUp/PageDown the pad page) never fires from a focused readout.
  Double-click sends the parameter's `default` (a return's 64; a band or pad send's the block's
  default in the API: reverb 100, chorus and delay 0) when it differs from the value. The
  press-and-drag is the only way to set a value on the screen; the knob page is the other
  (parity).
- **FX-D10 · Bar fraction.** `(value − min) / (max − min)` for every readout, 0–127 for returns
  and the band and pad sends (a bar past 100% shows the boost). The board drew the Note and Pad
  send bars by eye; the differences are under the screenshot threshold (Board fixture).
- **FX-D11 · Part sends are readouts that open Channel.** They show each keyboard part's send to
  the bus and open the part's Channel page (where the send is a control, #501); knobs 1–4 of the
  bus's knob page and the fader layer set them from the band. Dragging them here would make a
  fourth place for the same value.
- **FX-D12 · Parts opens Channel.** The per-part inserts (on/off and amount) live on each Style
  part's Channel page (Channel-StylePart, #501); Parts opens the first Style part that has an
  insert (`effects.inserts[0]`), and is disabled when the style has none. Until #501 lands,
  today's `ChannelView` has no insert controls, so `setPartInsertOn` and `setPartInsertAmount`
  would have no app control (parity): until then Parts opens today's Effects drawer
  (`ui.toggleDrawer('effects')` when `ui.effects` is false, `panels/effects/Effects.svelte`); on
  the next frame the wiring calls `scrollIntoView({ block: 'start' })` on the drawer's Inserts
  card, which gains `data-section="inserts"` for it (the drawer's only change),
  and the drawer stays in the code for that alone. Once #501 lands, Parts opens Channel as above
  and the drawer, its tests and its tooltip keys go (FXC1).
- **FX-D13 · Rotary fast toggles.** The lamp sends `toggleRotaryFast`, the command Shift +
  encoder page ▲ sends (parity), rather than `setRotaryFast`.
- **FX-D14 · The type readouts.** The comp type reads the preset's name (the board's "Natural")
  and the EQ one the EQ preset's name ("Flat"), not the board's "8 bands" (a constant tells the
  player nothing; the count is always eight). Both carry the edited dot when the settings differ
  from the type. The EQ text is masked in the screenshot.
- **FX-D15 · Master is #519.** The two type buttons open the Master bus once Effects-Master is
  built; until then they are `aria-disabled` with the default cursor (kit › Interaction
  conventions, the interim rule) but keep their `--a` text: they are value readouts, and the
  kit's `--d` disabled label would hide the value and move the screenshot off the board. The
  lamps still switch the compressor and EQ.
- **FX-D16 · Note line.** "Picking a type makes it Mine" (true by the API: `setEffectType` turns
  `followStyle` off; a return or send level never does) and the knob page sentence, for sends
  1–3; the rack sentence for added sends. It never changes with `followStyle` (the Segment shows
  that).
- **FX-D17 · Lamp height.** Tempo sync is the kit's 32px lamp (one control height, DECISIONS S2);
  the board's 30px is a 2px deviation under the threshold.
- **FX-D18 · Added send editor.** No Source (an added send never follows the style), a Picker for
  the kind (twelve kinds don't fit a Segment), Remove at the right, no Band or Pad rows (the API
  has none for added sends), its `params` as readouts with empty code cells.
- **FX-D19 · Fixture values.** The effect knobs' levels are what the engine sends
  (`param_reading` in `src/knobs.rs`: `(v − min) × 127 / (max − min)`, truncated): 36, 53, 26
  for knobs 5–7. The board's arcs were drawn by eye and differ under the threshold. The chorus is
  "From style" with the rack badge on, a state the session allows (`set_send_override` keeps
  `follow`; the style re-applies when the override is released).
- **FX-D20 · Knob names on the Delay page.** The plain names for the effect knob pages extend the
  Stage's D6 table: part sends by part name, `delayTime` "Time/Note", `fxParam` by its parameter
  word, `fxReturn` "Return". For kit.md's Knob section.
- **FX-D21 · Wiring.** `EffectsWiring.svelte` as the Stage's (D46); the clock and meter holds
  move into one shared module both wirings use, so the band ticks the same on every page.
- **FX-D22 · Keyboard.** Tab order is reading order: header, list, editor (title row, then the
  left column top to bottom, then the right), then the band. A Segment is one tab stop (roving
  focus: arrows move between its options). Readouts handle their own arrows and call
  `stopPropagation` (as faders).
- **FX-D23 · A removed or missing bus.** `shownBus` falls back to send 1 when `ui.effectsBus`
  names no send (removed, refused, or `'master'` before #519): never an empty editor, and the
  chosen row is always the one shown. Remove sets `ui.effectsBus` to 0.
- **FX-D24 · "Sends".** The header's second word is the fixed subtitle "Sends" while a send is
  open; #519 says what it reads with Master open (the board set says nothing).
- **FX-D25 · Links into this page.** Once this page lands, the Stage's band sends open it with
  the bus as it was and the master strip's name opens it with `ui.effectsBus = 'master'` (which
  `shownBus` turns into send 1 until #519, FX-D23); Stage.md D32's two Effects rows are dropped
  then.
- **FX-D26 · Status line.** The board draws none ("No status line or Back to stage button
  here"); the kit's status line is there, empty, as on every display page (Stage.md D15), and the
  tabs replace Back to stage.
- **FX-D27 · Chosen text weight.** The chosen row's name and a Segment's chosen option keep
  weight 400: the kit's chosen face is 500 for buttons (tabs, One Touch), but its header tabs are
  13 / 400 in the chosen block (kit › Faders), and these are that size. Only colours change.
- **FX-D28 · Esc.** Esc does nothing on this page (there is nothing to close: the page is a tab;
  `ui.escape` keeps closing drawers and the Channel view as today). Alt+E is a no-op while the
  page is shown (FX-D1).

## Follow-ups

- Effects-Master (#519), Effects-Reverb (#520), Effects-Chorus (#521): the other open buses.
- A per-part inserts list of its own (Parts), if opening Channel for one Style part proves too
  far from "on/off and amount" for the whole band.
- The Picker as a popover list in the Push skin, in place of a styled native `<select>`.
- The Part sends row clips its fourth button when every part's send is three digits; a narrower
  layout (a 72px label column, or 16px values) if that shows up in use.
- Fine steps on readouts (Shift + drag or arrows), as the knobs have.
- Move the Kit additions below into kit.md (an orchestrator PR, or the Channel spec #501, which
  the kit already names as the owner of the page app bar and the compact block).

## Kit additions

Parts that belong in kit.md (they are drawn on more than one board: Channel, Effects and the
Effects variants) but are written here because this lane owns only this file. Boxes are given
on the Effects board.

### Page app bar

`AppBar` with `variant="page"`: the Stage's app bar (kit › App bar) with, between the wordmark
and the tabs, the live rack readout and One Touch, so the tall and display pages that have no
display row of their own keep them in view. On Channel, Effects and their variants.

- **Rack readout** (`RackReadout` `variant="bar"`): `margin-left: 16px` (on top of the bar's 8px
  gap: 24px from the wordmark), a text button 32 tall, items on the baseline, gap 6, 14 / 400,
  no wrap: "Rack" `--m`, the slot
  `--t` ("A1"), the name `--t` ("Sunday drive"; `max-width: 200px`, ellipsis), then the 5px
  round `--t` modified dot (centred). Reads, opens and labels exactly as the Stage's rack readout
  (Stage.md › Sounds row › Rack: `liveRack.name`, `liveRack.modified`, the slot from
  `quickRacks`; no slot: "Rack" and the name; `onrack()`: the Rack page, interim the Rack
  drawer). Tooltip `stage.rack_name`. `aria-label` "Rack: {name}{, modified}{, on Quick Rack
  A1}. Opens the Rack page".
- **One Touch:** `margin-left: 12px` (20px from the rack readout), the Stage's One Touch group
  unchanged (Stage.md › Style line: "One Touch" 14 `--m`, four 32 × 32 buttons, `ots.applied`,
  `recallOts`, `ots.1`–`ots.4`, Launchkey Racks pad page pads 1–4).
- Then the page tabs (`margin-left: auto`) and the right area as the kit draws them.

### Compact block

`CompactBlock`, 320 × 84, the now-playing block of the tall and display pages (Channel, Effects
and their variants; the Channel board is its source). A `role="group"` with `aria-label` "Now
playing: {style}, {tempo} BPM, {running | sync start armed | stopped}, chord {chord} {tones} |
no chord, {section}" ("Now playing: Sunday Drive Pop, 104 BPM, running, chord Am7 A C E G, Main
B"; "Now playing: Sunday Drive Pop, 104 BPM, stopped, no chord, Main A"). A column: row 1 (16),
12, row 2 (48); the 8px left at the bottom is air.

- **Row 1** (16 tall, items centred, gap 8, no wrap): the **style name** as an accent block text
  button (AccentBlock), padding 0 6, 13 / 500, line-height 16, `--g` on `--a`, `min-width: 0`,
  ellipsis, reading `style.name`; click `onbrowser()` (the Browser, Stage.md D3); tooltip
  `browser.open`; `aria-label` "{name}: open the Browser". Then (`margin-left: auto`) the **tempo**:
  `transport.tempo` rounded (Stage.md D44) at 18 / 300, line-height 16, `--t`, and "BPM" 12 / 400
  `--m` with a 3px left margin; tooltip `display.tempo`; not a control. Then the **run dot**, 6px
  round: `transport.running` → `--ok` with `--bg`, `role="img"` `aria-label="Running"`; stopped
  with `transport.syncStart` → a hollow 1px `--ok` ring, "Sync start"; stopped → `visibility:
  hidden`, space kept (as Stage.md D43), no label.
- **Row 2** (12px below, 48 tall, items on the baseline, gap 14, no wrap): the **chord**
  `chord.name` at 48 / 300, line-height 48, letter-spacing −2, `--a`, `text-shadow: var(--ba)`,
  in the Stage's two runs (Stage.md D30; the extension at 200, letter-spacing 0); no chord: "—"
  in `--d`, no shadow. Then the **tones** 14 / 300, letter-spacing 3, `--t2`: the chord's tones
  as note names separated by spaces ("A C E G"), spelled and ordered as the Stage's tone columns
  (Stage.md D20, D31); no chord: empty. Then (`margin-left: auto`) the **playing section** at
  24 / 300, line-height 48, letter-spacing −0.5, in its hue, no glow (kit › Section names, Hue
  roles): running, `transport.section`; stopped, the Main to start on in `--m` (Stage.md D4).
  Tooltip `display.chord` on the chord. Not controls. **Fit:** the chord and the section are
  `flex: none` and never shrink; the tones span has `min-width: 0`, `overflow: hidden`,
  `text-overflow: ellipsis` and gives way first. At 48px the widest chord (`C#m7b5/G#`, about
  190px) with the widest section ("Ending III", about 110px) and the gaps leaves about 6px for
  the tones, which then read as "…"; no chord of `TYPE_NAMES` is wider.
- Beat, bar and the next section are not here: they live in the count row.

### Segment

`Segment`, a segmented choice: a `role="group"` with an `aria-label`, `display: flex`, no gap,
one `<button>` per option, 24 tall, padding 0 10, 13 / 400, no border, radius 0, no wrap.
Options are `{ value, label, tip }` (`tip` a `TipKey`, put on that option's button with
`use:tip`); `value` the chosen one. The chosen option wears the chosen face (`--t` fill, `--g`
text, `aria-pressed="true"`, `data-face="chosen"`); the others are `--m` text on nothing
(`aria-pressed="false"`, no `data-face`). The chosen option keeps weight 400 (FX-D27). Clicking
an option calls `onchoose(value)`; a click on the chosen one does nothing. One tab stop (roving
`tabindex`: the chosen option, or the last focused); ← → move focus between options without
wrapping, Home and End to the first and last, Space or Enter chooses the focused one; each of
those keys is `preventDefault`ed and `stopPropagation`ed (the window handler's ← → are
`stepStyle`). Not a fifth face: it is the chosen face at a 24px size, the same block the
fader-layer tabs use.

### Picker

`Picker`, a choice among more options than a Segment can show: a native `<select>` (so keyboard,
screen reader and the system list come free) drawn as the chosen block: 24 tall, padding `0 24px
0 10px`, 13 / 400, `--t` fill, `--g` text, no border, radius 0, `appearance: none`,
`data-face="chosen"`, with a "▾" (10px, `--g`, `pointer-events: none`) at right 8 drawn by the
component, `aria-label` and `tip` (a `TipKey`, `use:tip` on the select) given by the caller. `onchange` calls `onchoose(value)`. Options are `{ value,
label }` in the caller's order. Used by the added send's type here and the Master compressor's
type (#519).

### Badge

`Badge`, a small fixed label: padding 0 6, 12 / 400, line-height 20, `--t2` on `--past`, no
radius, no wrap, not a control. "Set by rack" is its only text so far.

### Readout

`Readout`, a labelled value with a bar, the Push-style parameter control (no sliders or knobs on
screen, DECISIONS M2): a focusable `<div tabindex="0" role="slider">` (not a `<button>`: axe
allows no slider role on one) of its row's width, 36 tall (box-sizing border-box,
`border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line)`), no padding, a grid `96px minmax(0, 1fr) 76px 28px`,
items centred, column-gap 12, text left, `cursor: pointer`:

- **Label** 13 / 400 `--m`, no wrap.
- **Bar** `aria-hidden`, `data-part="bar"`: a 2px `--mbg` track filling its cell, with a `--a`
  fill from the left, width `fraction × 100%` (FX-D10).
- **Value** right-aligned, 18 / 300, line-height 20, `--a`, no wrap, then the unit 12 / 400,
  also `--a`, with a 2px left margin (absent when the value has none).
- **Code** 12 / 400 `--t2`, no wrap: the Launchkey knob that moves it ("K5"), empty when none.
- **Props:** `label`, `value`, `min`, `max`, `defaultValue`, `display` (the text to show, unit
  included; the component splits it with `splitUnit`), `code`, `tip`, `disabled`; callback
  `onchange(value: number)`.
- **As a control:** `aria-label` = `label` (a slider needs a name), `aria-valuemin`,
  `aria-valuemax`, `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuetext` "{label} {display}"; pointer, wheel, keys
  and double-click per FX-D9 (the press anywhere on the element; `width` is the bar element's
  `getBoundingClientRect().width`; `setPointerCapture` is called only where it exists);
  `ew-resize` while dragging. `use:tip={tip}`. Focus ring as every control. Disabled:
  `aria-disabled`, label and value `--d`, no fill, default cursor, still focusable, no sends (no
  readout on this page is disabled; the prop is for the variants).
- **Maths** in `app/src/ui/Readout/readout.ts`: `fraction(value, min, max)` and `dragValue(v0,
  dx, width, min, max)` (pure, tested).

### Knob unit split

kit › Knob says a trailing "%" splits off the value as a 12 / 400 unit. Extend it: one pure
function `splitUnit(value: string): [string, string]` in `app/src/ui/Knob/splitUnit.ts`, shared
by Knob and Readout, splits a trailing "%" (no space) or a trailing " kHz", " Hz", " ms" or " s"
(after a space) off as the unit: "38%" → `["38", "%"]`, "5.0 kHz" → `["5.0", "kHz"]`, "0.29 Hz"
→ `["0.29", "Hz"]`, "22 ms" → `["22", "ms"]`, "2.4 s" → `["2.4", "s"]`. The list is closed:
anything else is returned whole with an empty unit ("3 of 8", "1/8", "L20", "Off"). The tempo
knob's " BPM" is dropped before the split (Stage.md D6).

### Lamp row in a layer

kit › Lamp row gives the master button "Panel" / "Style". In a fader layer other than Vol it is
two lines, a centred column, both `--t2`: "{Page} ·" 13 / 400, line-height 14, over the layer
word ("Pan", "Reverb", "Chorus", "Delay") 11 / 400, line-height 12 (one line would overflow the
65px cell). `aria-label` "Fader page {Page}, layer {Layer}: click for {other page}; Shift + click
steps the layer". The Stage's "Fader layer not Vol" state row draws it the same way.

### Interaction conventions

- A **hairline row list** (the send list, the readout columns): rows of a fixed height with
  `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line)`, no gap; the first row has no top line (the group header
  above it carries one).
- **Links into pages** (Stage.md D32): add rows "Effects page (this spec): band sends, the
  Effects tab → `ui.page = 'effects'`, the bus as it was" and "Master bus (#519): the master
  strip name, the comp and EQ type buttons → `ui.page = 'effects'`, `ui.effectsBus = 'master'`;
  until #519, the type buttons are disabled and `shownBus` turns `'master'` into send 1, so the
  strip name shows the page on send 1" (FX-D25).

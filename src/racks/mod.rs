//! Racks (docs/racks.md): what's under the player's hands, saved, recalled and swapped as
//! a whole. A [`Rack`] holds the four keyboard parts (Right 1-3 and Left), each with its
//! sound and mix, plus the split point, Harmony/Arpeggio, the keyboard transpose and the
//! controller map.
//!
//! This module is the model and its file, `Racks/<name>.rack.json` in the data folder
//! (format `yahaha.rack`, version 1). The session captures a rack from what plays and
//! applies one back (src/session/racks.rs). Nothing here depends on the session or on
//! Registration Memory.
//!
//! - A part's sound is a reference ([`SoundRef`]): a library sound by id, or a SoundFont
//!   preset. A plugin sound that differs from its saved sound carries the difference as the
//!   part's `edited_state`, never written into the sound.
//! - Mix (level, pan, sends, octave, tone, bend range, on/off) belongs to the rack part,
//!   never to the sound.
//! - Every write is atomic. A file made by a newer yahaha (a higher version) is refused and
//!   never saved over. Fields this build does not know are kept and written back.

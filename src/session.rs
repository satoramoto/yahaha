//! The session: one running arranger and the only way clients reach it.
//!
//! A [`Session`] owns the runtime: MIDI in and out, the engine thread, the built-in synth,
//! the Launchkey (pads, buttons, faders and LEDs) and the style library. Clients send
//! [`AppCmd`]s and read [`AppState`] snapshots; they never touch the engine, the
//! real-time atomics or the synth controls. docs/app-api.md is the contract.
//!
//! Threads (live):
//!
//!   CoreMIDI thread  keys, Launchkey pads/buttons/faders (`live::Input`)
//!   MIDI run loop    CoreMIDI's setup-change notifications (`midi::init`; devices.rs)
//!   engine thread    real-time playback (`live::run_engine`)
//!   control thread   runs Launchkey actions as `AppCmd`s, OTS Link, Launchkey LEDs,
//!                    library indexing, and republishes `AppState` when it changes
//!   audio thread     the synth (cpal)
//!   client threads   `Session::send` runs the command right there, under the control lock
//!
//! Only the control thread and client threads take locks. The CoreMIDI and engine threads
//! talk to the control side through SPSC rings, atomics and a semaphore, as before.
//!
//! An offline session ([`Session::offline`]) has no MIDI, audio or threads: the engine
//! runs on a virtual clock that [`Session::advance`] moves, and [`Session::midi_in`] plays
//! the part of the keyboard and the Launchkey. Tests and the app's dev mode use it.
//!
//! Layout: this file is the frame (the `Session` API, the control side's state, command
//! dispatch, the pump, publishing). Each feature is a module of `impl Control` blocks
//! with its command handler (`transport_cmd`, ...), its part of the state
//! (`transport_state`, ...) and its pump step if it has one; `apply`, `pump` and
//! `build_state` below call them in a fixed order (docs/architecture.md).

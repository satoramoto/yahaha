//! The Sound hold (docs/eyes-free.md, "Decisions"): while Panel fader button 6
//! (`launchkey::SOUND_FADER_BTN`) is held, on either fader page, the pads act and light as
//! the Racks page from any page (`Layer::Sound`); release brings back the page on view.
//!
//! Capture (hold Sound + tap the lit Quick Rack pad overwrites that rack with the live rack;
//! + tap an empty pad stores it as a new rack) is decided on the control side: only it knows
//! which button is lit or empty. Whether the tap came under the hold is decided here, on the
//! input thread, when the pad goes down: a Quick Rack pad sends `Action::QuickRackHeld`
//! instead of the Racks page's `Action::QuickRack`, so the control side never reads
//! `Shared::layer` (which may have changed by the time it runs the press). It captures on
//! the lit or an empty button (`storeRack`, which the app's pads send too) and recalls any
//! other. The Racks page's other pads (OTS, bank -/+, Store) act as on that page.
//!
//! Runs on the MIDI input thread: no allocation, locks or panics.

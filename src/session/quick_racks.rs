//! Quick Racks (docs/racks.md): the one-press rack buttons on the bar, Launchkey pad page 4
//! and the pedals, banks A-H of eight, kept in `<data>/quick-racks.json`. They replace
//! Registrations.
//!
//! - **Press** loads the button's rack as `loadRack` does, through the switching guard. From
//!   the Launchkey or a pedal (`Control::hardware`), which have no dialog, the switch goes
//!   ahead and unsaved changes are kept as a "Recovered: <name>" rack. A press on the lit
//!   button (the live rack's own) does the same from the app too: it recalls the rack clean
//!   with no prompt (the Genos reflex), unless sent with `discard`, which drops the changes.
//! - **Store** arms; the next press stores the live rack on that button. A rack with
//!   unsaved changes, or one never saved, is saved first: the button waits
//!   (`storeWaiting`) until `saveRack` / `saveRackAs` succeeds, then takes the saved rack.
//!   From the hardware there is no save flow, so Store there needs a saved rack.
//! - **Capture** (`storeRack`; hold Sound + tap a Racks pad, docs/eyes-free.md) needs no
//!   save flow: the live rack is saved as it goes on the button. On the button the live
//!   rack came from (lit), its changes are saved over that rack. Anywhere else, a saved rack
//!   with no changes goes on as it is; otherwise it is saved as a new rack named from its
//!   sounds ("Rhodes Soft + Strings"). Under the hold, a pad holding another rack recalls
//!   it, as the Racks page does. The input thread reads the hold when the pad goes down
//!   and sends `Action::QuickRackHeld`; `Control::apply_hardware` decides from that and the
//!   buttons alone, never from the layer (which may have been let go by then).
//! - **Previous.** Before a store saves the live rack's changes over the lit button's rack,
//!   that rack's file as it was is kept as the rack "Previous: <name>" (one per rack name,
//!   overwritten by the next).
//! - **Undo** (`undoQuickRackStore`) takes back the last store that changed a button or
//!   saved over a rack (in memory only): the button gets back what it held, and a rack
//!   saved over gets back its Previous copy's content (the copy then goes, unless a button
//!   names it). If that rack is the live one, the sound playing stays and shows unsaved.
//!   Sounds (plugin presets) the same save wrote over stay saved: Undo restores the rack
//!   and the button only. A new store replaces the undo; `clearQuickRack` drops it.
//! - A button names a rack by id, so a rename keeps it; deleting a rack empties its buttons.

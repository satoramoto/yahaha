# AGENTS.md

This file is the one place that says what must pass. CI runs these commands on every push to `develop`, after a PR has merged; nothing blocks the merge. On the PR itself CI builds nothing and its checks pass at once, so **run the checks below that cover your change locally before you merge**; if CI on `develop` then fails, fix it at once on a new branch. There is no other required process. CI skips the jobs a change can't affect: a Markdown-docs-only change runs only `api-doc`, a web-only change skips the Rust jobs, and a Rust-only change skips the web job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the `changes` job, says which files count as what).

## Checks

Each command must exit 0. Locally you run the core suite and the checks that cover your change; the full suite runs only in CI, on each push to `develop`. Don't run the full suite (Rust or web) locally: with several agents at once it stalls the machine.

**The core suite** is THE local check. Run it after any Rust change, or keep `bacon --headless core` running (see "Feedback loop"):

- `cargo test --workspace --exclude yahaha-app --profile test-quick --features plugins --lib` on macOS, or `cargo test --workspace --exclude yahaha-app --profile test-quick --lib` on Linux.

`--workspace --exclude yahaha-app` covers the `yahaha` facade and every layer crate under `crates/` (see "Layering"), and leaves out the app shell, which has its own check below. `default-members = ["."]` keeps a plain `cargo build` or `cargo test` at the repo root on the facade alone, so without `--workspace` the layer crates' own tests don't run. With `--lib` it builds and runs each package's library tests. The commands below without `--workspace` (`--test it`, `--test api_wire`, `--no-default-features --lib`, the example) target the facade's own targets on purpose.

It builds and runs the libraries' unit tests, with debug assertions and overflow checks on, and leaves out the slow tests: those marked `#[cfg(feature = "slow-tests")]` (corpus sweeps, long audio renders, plugin-hosting round trips, real-time waits), which aren't even compiled. It doesn't build the binary, the integration tests or the example either. On the 10-core Mac, warm, after a one-line edit in `src/session/mixer.rs`: 4.7 s to rebuild, then about 2 s to run. To run a single test, add its name. A new test that takes more than about 0.25 s goes behind `slow-tests`.

**Also run** the ones that cover your change:

- `cargo test --profile test-quick --features plugins --test it` (Linux: without `--features plugins`). The integration tests, most of them the no-allocation checks of the engine, audio and MIDI threads. Run them when you change code that runs on those threads. Add a test name to run one.
- `cargo test --profile test-quick --test api_wire`. The app API's wire format. Run it when `src/api` changed.
- The corpus tests. They need the git-ignored `corpus/` (see "Corpus"), so CI can't run them; they are behind `slow-tests` and run only here. When you change a module that has corpus tests, run them once for that module: `cargo test --workspace --exclude yahaha-app --profile test-quick --features plugins,slow-tests <module>` (for example `sff`, `capture`, `oracle`, `golden`, `session::style_change`, `fx::xg`, `engine::part_state`, `library`). Without the corpus they skip without failing, so a pass without it covers nothing.
- `cargo test --profile test-quick` in `app/src-tauri`. The app shell's Rust tests; on macOS they run with plugins. Run them when `app/src-tauri`, `src/api` or `src/session` changed. The app shell is a member of the root workspace, so this reuses the dependency builds of the core suite.
- In `app/`, after `npm ci` on a fresh checkout: `npm run check` and `npm run lint`, and `npx vitest run <file>...` for the web tests that cover your change. Run them when anything under `app/` changed. The whole web suite (`npm run verify`) runs in CI.
- The UI library (`app/src/ui`, see `docs/factory/`), in `app/`. Its stories are tests: `npx vitest run src/ui` renders every story under `app/src/ui` in dark and light, runs its `play` function and checks its controls, actions and accessibility (`app/src/ui/stories.test.ts`; `npm run test` includes it); it also covers the token contrast test (`app/src/ui/tokens/contrast.test.ts`, AA 4.5:1 for each text token on its surface, since jsdom can't check contrast). `npm run lint` rejects colour literals in its components (the rule is `app/scripts/lint/no-colour-literals.js`, tested by `npx vitest run scripts/lint`) and store, API or Tauri imports. Run both when anything under `app/src/ui` or `app/.storybook` changed. `npm run storybook` serves Storybook at http://localhost:6006 for looking at it (stop it when done); `npm run build-storybook` builds it, which checks that every story and docs page compiles. `npm run shots -- <Name>` screenshots that component's stories in dark and light into `app/.shots/<Name>/` and scores each against its board crop in `app/src/ui/<Name>/crops/`, and runs axe (colour contrast included) on every story in Chrome (`report.json`; exits 1 when a shot isn't the crop's size, scores over the pass score, or has an axe violation). It builds Storybook itself and drives the system Chrome, and stops both when it ends. Run it for UI library work that changes how a component looks; CI doesn't.
- `cargo check --no-default-features --lib`. The library with no features. Run it when you change `#[cfg(feature = ...)]` code.
- In bash, from the repo root: ``diff <(awk '/^## AppCmd/{f=1} /^### Result/{f=0} f && /^\| `/' docs/app-api.md | cut -d'|' -f2 | grep -o '`[^`]*`' | tr -d '`' | sort -u) <(awk '/^const EVERY_CMD/,/^\];/' tests/api_wire.rs | sed -n 's/^ *r#"{"type":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' | sort -u)``. This checks that `EVERY_CMD` in `tests/api_wire.rs` names exactly the commands in the AppCmd tables of `docs/app-api.md`, and prints any difference. Run it when either file changed. CI runs it on every push to `develop`, docs-only ones included (the `api-doc` job). No code or test compiles in or reads a committed file under `docs/`; keep it that way, so a docs-only change can't change what CI tests.
- `cargo run --no-default-features --example api_doc_check -- docs/app-api.md`. This checks that every `{"type": ...}` JSON example in `docs/app-api.md`, and its example `AppState`, parses into the app API's Rust types (`AppCmd`, `Event`, `AppState`) and serializes back unchanged; it prints each mismatch and exits 1. The doc is read at run time from the path given, never compiled in. Run it when `docs/app-api.md` or the API types in `src/api` changed. CI runs it on every push to `develop`, docs-only ones included (the `api-doc` job). Its own tests run with `cargo test`.

**CI on each push to `develop`** runs everything (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `cargo check --no-default-features --lib` and `cargo test --workspace --exclude yahaha-app --profile test-quick --features slow-tests` on Linux; `cargo test --workspace --exclude yahaha-app --profile test-quick --features plugins,slow-tests` on macOS (every target of the facade and the layer crates: the libraries, the binary, the integration tests and the example; slow tests included); `cargo check --all-targets` (Linux) and `cargo test --profile test-quick` (macOS) in `app/src-tauri`; `npm run verify` in `app/`; and the two API doc checks. CI has no corpus, so the corpus tests skip there.

## Builds and concurrency

- One Cargo workspace: the `yahaha` facade (the repo root), the layer crates (`crates/*`, see "Layering") and the app shell (`app/src-tauri`, package `yahaha-app`) share `Cargo.lock` and the worktree's `target/`. A plain cargo command at the repo root builds only the facade (`default-members`); `--workspace --exclude yahaha-app` adds the layer crates.
- Each worktree keeps its own `target/`. Don't point worktrees at one shared target directory: cargo names our crate's build outputs the same in every checkout and decides freshness by file times, so a worktree can reuse another worktree's build of different source and test the wrong code (measured: after a build in one checkout, the other checkout's build reported nothing to do).
- A new worktree's first core-suite build compiles our crate from scratch: 49 s on the 10-core Mac, using every core. Dependencies come from sccache when it's set up (`rustc-wrapper = "sccache"` in `~/.cargo/config.toml`). Warm, after an edit, a rebuild takes about 5 s and two worktrees rebuilding at once take 5.4 s each, against 4.7 s alone.
- So when several lanes build Rust at once, start them one at a time: the next lane's first build begins once the previous lane's first build has finished. After that, they can edit and run the core suite side by side.
- No thread caps (`RUST_TEST_THREADS`, `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`): they measured no faster.

## Lanes

When an orchestrator splits work across agents, each lane owns its files and no two lanes edit the same file.

- **Contract files** (the app API): `src/api/*`, `docs/app-api.md`, `tests/api_wire.rs` (`EVERY_CMD`), `tests/fixtures/state.json`, `app/src/lib/api/types.ts`, `app/src/lib/api/mock.ts` and `mock.test.ts`, `app/src-tauri/src/mock.rs`, `app/src/help/tooltips.ts`, `app/src/help/actions.ts`, `app/docs/controls.md`. A change to the contract lands first, as its own small PR; the lanes that build on it merge `develop` once it lands.
- **UI library contract files** (`app/src/ui`, see `docs/factory/`): `app/src/ui/tokens/*`, `app/.storybook/*`, `app/src/ui/stories.test.ts`, the shots script (`app/scripts/shots.ts`, `shots-diff.ts` and `shots-diff.test.ts`), the colour-literal lint rule and its test (`app/scripts/lint/*`), and the library's rules in `app/eslint.config.js` and its story-test plugin in `app/vite.config.ts`. Every other file under `app/src/ui/<Name>/` is owned by that component's PR alone.
- **Hotspots** (one owner per feature at a time): `app/src/panels/mixer/Mixer.svelte` and `Mixer.test.ts`, `Strip.svelte`, `crates/yahaha-synth/src/synth.rs`, `crates/yahaha-synth/src/synth/rack.rs`, `crates/yahaha-fx/src/fx.rs`, `tests/it/synth_no_alloc.rs`.
- **Stage pages** (the UI rewrite): each display page lane (Channel, Effects, Quick Racks, Multi Pads, Looper, Harm/Arp) owns its `app/src/panels/<dir>/` (its `<Name>Page.svelte`, the `PageProps` stub the contract left there), the new `app/src/ui/<Name>/` folders it adds, and `app/src/help/tips/<page>.ts`. Existing `app/src/ui` components, `app/src/help/tooltips.ts` and the Stage wiring (`app/src/panels/stage/`) are shared and change only in a contract PR.

## Feedback loop

While editing, run [bacon](https://dystroy.org/bacon) headless in your worktree (`cargo install --locked bacon`). It re-runs its job on every source change and, after every run, rewrites `.bacon-result.json` (git-ignored). Start it as a background command, and stop it when you're done or before switching job.

Every job runs with `--workspace --exclude yahaha-app`: the facade and the layer crates, not the app shell.

- `bacon --headless` runs the `check` job: `cargo check --workspace --exclude yahaha-app --all-targets --features plugins`. On Linux, use `bacon --headless check-portable`.
- `bacon --headless core` runs the core suite on every change. On Linux, use `bacon --headless core-portable`.
- `bacon --headless test -- <filter>` runs targeted tests under the `test-quick` profile, in every package. Add `--lib` before the filter for library tests only.
- `jq '{error_code, stats}' .bacon-result.json` shows the latest result. `error_code` is null when the command exited 0; `stats` counts errors, warnings and failed tests.
- `jq -r '.lines[] | [.content.strings[].raw] | join("")' .bacon-result.json` lists each error, warning and failed test with its location.
- `find src tests crates Cargo.toml -newer .bacon-result.json` prints nothing when the result covers your last edit. If it prints a file, the run hasn't finished yet; read the result once, later, rather than looping.

The jobs are in `bacon.toml`: `check`, `check-portable`, `core`, `core-portable`, `clippy` and `test`. bacon is only for fast feedback; the checks above and CI decide.

## Review

No review is required: nothing on GitHub blocks a merge. Review a PR only when the owner asks for one; then post it on the PR as line comments plus a verdict (`gh pr review --approve` or `--request-changes`).

**Review account:** `satori-miyamoto`. Post reviews with `GH_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/gh-yahaha-bot gh …`, and check first that `gh api user --jq .login` prints `satori-miyamoto`. Use it only for reviews. Everything else (commits, PRs, merges) uses the owner's default `gh` login.

Reviewers, and anyone checking their own change, flag only these, each with the file, the line and a one-line reason:

- **Real-time safety:** no allocation, locks, panics or blocking I/O on the audio, engine or MIDI threads.
- **Mixer:** a style feature is mapped onto one of yahaha's own mixer concepts (see "Engine rules"), not added as a new, hidden or duplicate level. Anything that changes how loud a part is shows on a control: that part's strip or the group control that scales it.
- **Parity:** nothing is hardware-only. Every Launchkey function has an app control; every new control has a tooltip; every new command is in both mocks (TS and the Rust dev mock), in docs/app-api.md and in EVERY_CMD in tests/api_wire.rs.
- **Layering:** no new upward imports in the order core → sff, fx → engine → synth → the `yahaha` facade (see "Layering"; for example, sff or theory reaching into engine or session; synth reaching into session). Move shared types down instead.
- **Public repo:** no style data, soundfonts, manual text or real plugin state blobs committed.
- **Bugs:** wrong logic, broken migrations of saved files, and tests that would pass without the code under test working.

Don't comment on style or naming. Put small edge cases in a follow-up issue rather than blocking the PR.

## Linux

See "Developing on Linux" in README.md.

## Branches

PRs target `develop` and are squash-merged. `develop` merges into `main` only when the owner says so, with a merge commit, so `main` keeps `develop`'s commits and the next release PR shows only new work. No ruleset enforces this; keep to it by hand.

There is no branch protection and no merge queue. Once your local checks pass, merge with `gh pr merge --squash`. CI then runs the full suite on the push to `develop`; if it fails, fix it on a new branch right away.

## Never commit

Style data, manual text, soundfonts, or real plugin state. Research transcripts and frames live in `../yahaha-research`, not this repo. Mocks use the fake "Sampler Deluxe" plugin.

## Corpus

It's git-ignored, and only the corpus tests (behind `slow-tests`) read it. To run them in a worktree, symlink it: `ln -s "<main checkout>/corpus" corpus`. With the corpus, all of them together take about 5 minutes of every core, so run them one module at a time (see "Checks").

## Engine rules

No allocation, locks or panics on the engine, MIDI or audio threads.

Mixer: support everything a style does, but map it onto yahaha's own concepts rather than adding a gain stage per feature. A part's level is its fader (its CC7) plus master. The Style volume, the Multi Pad volume and the Fade scale the CC7 that's sent, not the audio. A part's EQ is tone on its strip; it may boost as well as cut. Nothing changes a part's loudness without showing on a control: its own strip, or the group control that scales it (the Style and Multi Pad volume faders, the Fade). Where a style feature has no mapping yet and adding one is small, extend our concept rather than drop or fake the feature (for example, a filter type our EQ lacks: add the filter type). A large gap goes in a follow-up issue, named in the PR body.

## Controls

Every control has a tooltip in `app/src/help/tooltips.ts`. Every command is in both mocks (TS and the Rust dev mock), in `docs/app-api.md`, and in `EVERY_CMD` in `tests/api_wire.rs`. Nothing is hardware-only: every Launchkey function has an app control.

## rustysynth

rustysynth is an unmodified dependency from crates.io (`rustysynth = "1.3.6"`). Never vendor or patch it. Build what it lacks in yahaha, on its public API (see `crates/yahaha-synth/src/synth/`).

## Layering

No new upward imports between modules. The workspace is split into layer crates under `crates/`, each depending only on the ones below it. The split is complete: each layer's modules live in its crate under `crates/*/src`, and the facade's `src/` holds only the modules that sit on top of all of them (session, api, live and the rest of its row below):

| Crate | Modules | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `yahaha-core` | `rt`, `route`, `style_types`, `theory`, `tone`, `voice_gm`, `parts_data`, `data_files`, `midi`, `click`, `arp`, `harmony`, `fingering`, `looper`, `ireal`, `megavoice` | nothing |
| `yahaha-sff` | `sff`, `library` | core |
| `yahaha-fx` | `fx` | core |
| `yahaha-engine` | `engine`, `multipad`, `parts`, `controllers`, `launchkey`, `sim` | core, sff, fx |
| `yahaha-synth` | `synth`, `patches`, `plugin`, `perf` (the `plugins` feature and the objc2 dependencies) | core, sff, fx, engine |
| `yahaha` (the facade, the repo root) | `session`, `api`, `knobs`, `racks`, `live`, `capture`, `oracle`, `golden`, `recognizer_golden`, `bench`, `ui`, `main` | all of them |

The DSP core (the synth) sits above the engine, not below it, because the synth uses `engine::Parts`; only fx sits below the engine. This replaces the earlier sketch (core → sff → dsp → engine → plugin).

- **Extraction rule:** a module moves down into its crate only when nothing its production code imports lives above that crate. A test in it that needs a higher layer moves up to the facade (or into `tests/`) with the move.
- **Paths keep working:** the facade's `src/lib.rs` re-exports each moved module (`pub use yahaha_core::theory;`), so `crate::theory::…` and `yahaha::theory::…` paths keep resolving.
- Shared types already moved down for this: `Sink` lives in `midi` and `shift_key` in `theory` (the engine re-exports `shift_key`).

## Genos behaviour

Answer from the manuals in `docs/manuals` (git-ignored, local only), not by asking the owner. If the manuals are silent, pick the behaviour closest to the Genos and record "Decision: ..." in the PR body.

## Tests

Tests may use the real plugin cache, but a test that needs a stable plugin list uses a mock cache.

## Disk

A worktree's `target/` takes about 0.7 GB for the core suite, 1.2 GB with every test target, and 2.3 GB once the app shell's tests are built too. Remove it with the worktree once its PR has merged. Keep at least 8 GB free.
